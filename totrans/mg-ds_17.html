<p class="p1">First of all, thank you for reading this book! I hope that the material was helpful in presenting the overall management approach to data science projects. Data science management is a multidimensional topic that requires a manager to show technical, organizational, and strategic proficiency so that they can execute a data science strategy inside any organization.</p>
<p class="p1">First, the data science manager needs to understand what data science can do, as well as its technical limitations. Without an understanding of the basic concepts, it is extremely easy to misunderstand your colleagues or provide over-promising project results to the customer. The <em>What is Data Science</em> section of this book described the basics of machine learning and deep learning, including explanations behind the mathematical concepts that comprise machine learning algorithms. We explored the world of technology and business metrics, defined mathematical optimization, and looked into statistics and probability. These concepts helped us define how machines learn using maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we can explain almost every machine learning algorithm using this mathematical framework. We have also seen that there is no silver bullet in the machine learning world thanks to the no free lunch theorem. This theorem states that no machine learning algorithm will be better than random choice if you measure its accuracy over all possible datasets and tasks.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, our journey continued toward the <em>Building and sustaining a team</em> section, where we learned about balancing long-term and short-term team building goals. We talked about the flaws of over-complicated technical interviews and how to avoid them. The main idea here was to look at what you need and then search for people with specific skill sets, rather than a rockstar data scientist who can do anything. We also discussed how to conduct data science interviews using real-world experience. Then, we explored the concept of team balance, which forms the long-term stability of teams that allows them to grow and develop. We also touched on the important topic of the growth mindset. By following this practice yourself, you become an example to your team.</p>
<p class="p1">In the <em>Managing data science projects</em> section, we focused on project management, starting from a bird's-eye strategic view on innovations and marketing. We drew connections between innovations and data science and provided high-level strategies for managing innovations in different kinds of organizations. We have looked at data science project management on a lower scale and examined processes that we can use to manage individual projects. Then, we defined the data science project life cycle based on CRISP-DM and looked over common mistakes that customers, managers, and implementation teams make when delivering data science solutions. We also touched on the topic of software component reusability and stated that creating reusable components will ease the development of your projects and increase your team's business potential.</p>
<p class="p1">In conclusion, the<em> Creating development infrastructure</em> section comprised discussions on engineering aspects of data science projects. We discussed how to create a technology stack based on customer requirements and your own core technological expertise. Finally, we saw how to create comparison matrices in order to choose between different technologies.</p>

<p>Congratulations on finishing this book! I hope that it helped you deepen your knowledge of data science and systemize management techniques for data science projects. Please don't leave what you have read about the theory of data science behind. To master the concepts we have covered in this book, you should apply them to your daily work. I also strongly advise you to acquire a growth mindset, if you haven't already. You will be amazed by how far you can go by learning something new each day, even if it's the smallest bit of knowledge. No book can fully cover every aspect of data science management, but you can continue this journey by referring to one of the books mentioned in this chapter or discovering your own path while mastering data science.</p>

    is. The dictionary definition of innovation states that it is something new or
    something that's introduced in a different manner; an introduction of new things
    or methods. Every innovation is temporary. Edison's light bulb was once innovatory,
    as were cars. Successful innovations invade our daily lives like a tempest, change
    them forever, and then become mundane. Failed innovations fade and become forgotten.

    first appeared in 1886, but cars only really started changing our lives 27 years
    later, when the Ford Motor Company built the first moving assembly line in 1913\.
    If you define innovation in terms of an inventor's success, the invention of the
    first car may be a huge breakthrough. But from a business perspective, we may
    only consider an innovation successful if it creates a new market with a stable
    income flow. Technical innovation advances the field, while business innovation
    creates some new, previously unavailable value. This value helps new markets emerge
    and new businesses rise.

    you heard about this new artificial intelligence start-up? Just imagine what we
    can achieve in this field. Our resources are vast compared to other companies*.
    However, history dictates otherwise, since emerging innovative technologies are
    often born inside small start-ups rather than in big, stable businesses. This
    is counterintuitive. Large companies have more resources, people, time, and risk
    immunity, while start-ups have almost none. Then why do big corporations fail
    at innovation? *The Innovator's Dilemma*, by Clayton Christensen ([https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244)),

    tell a convincing story that is supported by data. Innovations generate little
    to no revenue in the first stages of development. In large companies, innovative
    products will often compete with the best offers of the company. If you look at
    this from this angle, innovation seems legitimate in a start-up company, while
    being incompatible with the existing revenue channels of a big company. Small
    companies strive to get income, and competing with large corporations in developed
    markets is not an option. Small start-ups won't have enough resources to deliver
    competitive products that the market needs. Thus, the natural way for start-up
    survival is innovation.

    Professor Clayton Christensen uses small **hard disk drives** (**HDDs**) as an
    example of this. In the era of large HDDs, everyone used them as an industry standard.
    Smaller models were fun in theory but unusable in practice since, at the time,
    the hardware was only supported on larger HDD models. Larger HDDs also had more
    capacity, speed, and reliability. When the market of personal computers emerged,
    small HDDs instantly became more attractive. Power consumption and size were the
    parameters that PC owners cared for. New revenue streams helped the development
    of small HDDs. After some time, smaller models surpassed their larger counterparts
    in terms of capacity, speed, and reliability. It was already too late for the
    old generation of HDDs. Large companies who seemed stable 5 years ago lost their
    market to new, superior technology.

    but they cannot predict the end results and struggle to define deadlines. These
    qualities of innovations make them hard to implement in a business environment,
    where clearly defined goals, strict deadlines, and finite budgets are the norm.
    Innovation management provides a set of techniques that bring order into a chaotic
    realm of innovations. The word *management* is associated with direct control,
    but this is not the case for innovations. Freedom is critical for every innovation.
    You won't get any positive results by trying to micromanage. Innovation management
    is about providing support and integrating innovations into existing businesses
    so that they deliver helpful results.

    disruptive innovations change the way we live and work, thus creating new markets
    and making old ones obsolete. From a layman observer's perspective, disruptive
    innovations may appear all of a sudden, but in reality, they are not a flash of
    insight. *The Innovator's Dilemma* contains many examples of disruptive innovations
    that grew in small markets, where features of innovative products were more appealing
    for very specific use cases. A stable source of income allows innovative technology
    to grow to its potential, while companies that provide old-generation products
    do not see the direct competition on their market. When the new product disrupts
    the market, it is already too late.

    market that comprises companies who are willing to pay money for risky, untested,
    experimental, but promising solutions. Many organizations think that the transition
    from the early market to the mainstream market will be smooth; the early market
    will produce enough income so that it can create new features that will be valuable
    to the mainstream market. However, this is not the case in practice. The gap between
    early and mainstream markets is much larger than it seems. When the early market
    saturates, the company enters the chasm. Its offering is not mature and developed
    enough for the mainstream market, where customers are used to feature-rich and
    stable products. So, the company is forced to live with a diminished income stream,
    while its product requires large investments so that it can create the features
    that have been requested by the mainstream market.

    specific area of application where its product's best features are more important
    than its current flaws. The goal is to find a tiny but reliable niche and concentrate
    on perfecting it. This creates a small market that will allow you to grow momentum
    through success stories, functionality, customer references, and new income streams.

    an organization where data science has already made an impact, you will find cross-functional
    product teams where experts have one or two roles assigned to them. The picture
    is different for organizations that are just getting started with data science
    or who are working to establish a business using advanced data analytics and predictive
    modeling. In those teams, a data science manager is more likely to hold the majority,
    if not all, of the essential management areas.

    science manager. You need to make sure that your projects are implemented with
    the right tools and that they have been designed to achieve your customer's goals.
    On the other hand, you need to care about your team's motivation and long-term
    improvement. Advocating a growth mindset and building a balanced team will serve
    as a strong backbone when it comes to building better technology.

    has a dedicated sales department, you'll need to sell your ideas to them first.
    If data science is relatively new in your company, salespeople will be familiar
    with the existing offerings of the company, but they won't know how to sell data
    science solutions to customers. Either you need to know how to do it yourself,
    or you need to speak the language of sales to coach the sales department on how
    to approach data science solutions. Another case where you will need these skills
    is internal sales. For example, this skill set is necessary when the data science
    department is optimizing internal business processes. This is a frequent case
    in banking and internet companies. In this situation, a data science manager will
    need to find ideas, make them attractive and clear so that they can be understood,
    identify stakeholders, and close an internal sale to attract budgets for your
    project. Without sales, even the best teams and the most disruptive technology
    will find themselves without any work to do. Looking at your duty from the salesman
    perspective will open up a surprising number of opportunities, so don't miss them.
  prefs: []

    opportunities, and each will need significant time investments from your team.
    Some opportunities will be realistic and match technology and expertise of your
    team, while others will be much less attractive. It's time to put on your marketing
    hat so that you can navigate through this sea of opportunities. Thinking about
    your work in terms of markets, demands, and products will allow you to choose
    the best direction to work toward. With each finished project, your team's skills
    and your technology will be drawn closer to one set of opportunities and further
    from the others. Marketing is all about searching in the most promising way and
    growing in the direction where your technology will meet the market's demands,
    thus creating new value.

- en: In this case study, we will look at a data science manager, Carl, who is working
    in a fictional retail company. He and his team have prototyped a solution that
    will improve the availability of on-shelf goods. This solution will monitor goods
    across all the stores and notify the shop staff so that they can bring in new
    goods if the shelves are empty. The company's management has asked Carl to grow
    the prototype into a complete solution and integrate it into the existing on-shelf
    availability process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the current process, each store has two to five goods availability managers
    who manually monitor each shelf in the store using an app on their smartphones.
    The app showed up to date goods locations on each shelf, but the manager needs
    to manually check whether the goods are present. After the check, the manager
    can take note of all the missing products and go to the store's warehouse to get
    the goods and place them on the shelves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, Carl has asked the company's management to introduce him to the person
    who's responsible for the current on-shelf availability across all stores. It
    turns out that one of the executive directors, who manages logistics, delivery,
    and the on-shelf availability of goods, owns this process. Carl has prepared a
    detailed presentation that describes the results of the pilot project. He told
    the company that he needs the director's help in preparing the requirements for
    the system so that it can be integrated into the existing business process since
    the director has this organizational capability. The current business process
    was well-documented, and each step was assigned to a specific business role. To
    create a migration plan, they interviewed experts who executed the target process.
    Carl showed the current prototype to the experts and documented their ideas on
    how to improve the technology so that could be smoothly integrated into the workflow.
    Each new feature formed the backlog for the upcoming implementation project. Along
    with new features and ideas, changes regarding the business process came up naturally.
    Some of them were conflicting and poorly defined, so Carl assigned a business
    analyst to the project to formalize the migration plan into a coherent document.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'After this, Carl presented the results to the director. The integration of
    the new system significantly changed the existing process. Previously, the store
    managers who monitored the on-shelf availability of goods were manually going
    through the store to monitor the availability of the goods, but now, this task
    can be fully automated using portable cameras near each shelf. A manager will
    receive task notifications through the mobile application and each task will contain
    precise information about the good''s storage location, quantity, and shelf location.
    The application will batch tasks together and create optimal routes through the
    store''s storage. Since all the store''s availability managers already have smartphones,
    the integration will be simple: the users will need to update the app on their
    phone and familiarize themselves with the new features.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key idea behind the integration strategy that was proposed by Carl was to
    test the system in a single store first. The test would be considered successful
    if the store could handle its current workload using only half of the availability
    management personnel. This way, the project would have measurable success criteria.
    If the first test succeeds, then the system will undergo tests on a larger number
    of stores. This process will be repeated and migrated to all the stores so that
    it's the to-be version of the process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's clear that each store will need fewer availability managers after the system
    integration process. To have open processes and clear explanations, the director
    has designed a special training program for personnel that won't be needed for
    this job after the system is online. Other departments are working hard to find
    new people, so redistributing the workforce is a very appealing option. Carl's
    team also created an in-depth on-site training course and in-app tutorials that
    describe how the users can work with the new app.

    in large organizations. It also costs more in the short term because of the fast
    experimentation rates and increased risks of failure. This makes innovations tricky
    to work with in a large company. Existing short-to-mid term values and goals will
    reject innovations, just like an immune system would reject a virus. It is important
    to provide organizational and financial support to the R&D and innovation departments
    in established businesses. Innovation teams work best when they are deployed as
    a company inside a company. While the main business may be working efficiently
    with the organizational structures with many hierarchical departments and management
    chains, innovations work best when the organizational ladder is very high and
    there are one or two steps from an employee to a top manager.

    implement than in a large, slowly moving business. However, there is a significant
    difference between a start-up and an established company. Start-ups cannot afford
    to make a lot of mistakes. Stable income streams allow large companies to test
    many ideas simultaneously, whereas start-ups are often limited to evolving in
    one simultaneous direction.

    is to find a new market where it can grow upon itself and provide value that doesn't
    exist. Matching your idea and your technology to market demands involves a lot
    of quantifiable experimentation. It is important to use a measurable approach
    that is advocated in *The Lean Startup* and *Crossing the Chasm* methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*The Lean Startup* method recommends that you test every idea and every feature
    on the market early. Conducting experiments and getting feedback is crucial for
    start-ups because each choice you make limits your future development. The sooner
    your product receives market feedback, the sooner you can change its course before
    it''s too late. A company with good R&D practices and big budgets can test ideas
    in computer vision, NLP, and reinforcement learning for long-term payoffs. They
    can even create entire branch organizations so that they can test ideas. On the
    other hand, a computer vision start-up will have a much harder time pivoting to
    NLP because of the shorter profit expectations.'

- en: Start-ups need to be lean, fast, and agile to survive. Looking at your idea
    through the marketing lens is a crucial skill for a small aspiring company. Even
    the best idea won't survive long enough without proper economic development. Because
    of the large gap between the expectations of early adopters and the early majority,
    a start-up needs to have a narrow focus, seeking to satisfy the needs of a niche
    customer base. In this chapter's example, MedVision (see the *Case study* – *following
    the innovation cycle at MedVision* section) has implemented a lung cancer classifier.
    They have measured the market demand for several alternatives and identified cancer
    classification as the most promising and realistic use case. In the short term,
    they plan to have several successful deployments to attract income and new customers.
    In the long term, they plan to collect market feedback to expand their system's
    functionality to more medical equipment types and expand their disease identification
    list. The key idea is to direct your product toward market satisfaction by conducting
    experiments and collecting measurable feedback.

    fraud detection process is mostly manual; however, some simple rule-based detectors
    are also implemented in the system.

    claims depending on a customer's data would improve risk identification and contract
    pricing. More risky customers would receive more expensive tariffs. Rick has assembled
    a team and has started prototyping the new scoring algorithm using data from the
    **Insurance Policy Registry**, **Back Office System**, and **Scoring & Tariff
    System**. The company was planning to implement a binary classifier that would
    estimate the probability of a valid claim for each new client. The business people
    at the car insurance department were already familiar with the concept of false-positive
    and false-negative errors, so they have used confusion tables to compare the performance
    of current and new scoring algorithms. The business department has refused to
    use more complex metrics such as an F1 score and suggested calculating the increase
    of profits directly from the confusion tables.

- en: After three weeks of prototyping, Rick's team created a classifier that was
    superior to the current rule-based algorithm of the **Scoring & Tariff System**.
    They sent their predictions to the business department for evaluation. After 30
    minutes, the business department asked for explanations for each score. It turned
    out that the current scoring system generated a detailed quarterly report and
    sent it to a regulatory organization that checked the validity of the scoring
    model that was used at the company. The model should be fully interpretable and
    understandable by humans. Rick's team used a black-box model with a large number
    of parameters to achieve high accuracy, so their model failed this requirement.
    Interpretable models such as logistic regression are more suitable here, but their
    performance was subpar for the current system, making them unsuitable for deployment.

    He deepened his domain expertise by asking his colleagues from the car insurance
    department about every detail of the business process and documented it for clarity.
    While researching, he validated that the fraud detection process was far more
    suitable for migration to a machine learning model:'

    one of their primary sources of loss. The decision process was time-consuming
    and every claim needs to be checked, so the overall quality of fraud detection
    was decreasing.

- en: The main problem was that the clients needed more detailed reasoning behind
    claim rejection than, *Our model thought that your insurance claim is fraudulent,
    so we rejected it*. So, Rick has suggested that the company only uses an algorithm
    for fraud detection. The idea was to create a machine learning-based filter that
    would assess the probability of a claim being fraudulent. If this probability
    is high enough, it triggers the current fraud investigation process. Only 0.5%
    of all claims were fraudulent, so if the model is accurate, it should decrease
    the number of checks significantly.

    system will be implemented and how it will be integrated into the existing process.
    He met with all the business stakeholders to validate his idea. Everyone agreed
    with the approach. The evaluation strategy they agreed on was the same as the
    scoring model. After that, the next prototyping stage began. The model was proven
    to be successful, and Rick was asked to implement the full fraud detection module that
    would be integrated into the existing business process.

    them. Good innovation management requires us to carefully plan our own activity
    and use different viewpoints such as sales, marketing, and technical leadership
    to match our ideas with market requirements.

    Next, looked at the complexities of integrating innovations into big organizations
    and start-ups. Data science is an innovative activity for most organizations,
    and we have defined several strategies that we can use to find project ideas and

    to innovation management. The first one, *following the innovation cycle at MedVision*,
    showed us how an innovation cycle can be applied in a real-world scenario. The
    second one was about *bringing data science to a retail business,* where weexplored
    innovation management in large organizations. The last one, *finding data science
    project ideas in an insurance company*, demonstrated the importance of using a
    structured approach for finding data science project ideas.

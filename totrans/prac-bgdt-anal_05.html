                    <h1 class="header-title">Big Data Mining with NoSQL</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The term <strong>NoSQL</strong> was first used by Carlo Strozzi, who, in 1998, released the Strozzi NoSQL opensource relational database. In the late 2000s, new paradigms in database architecture emerged, many of which did not adhere to the strict constraints required of relational database systems. These databases, due to their non-conformity with standard database conventions such as ACID compliance, were soon grouped under a broad category known as NoSQL.</p>
<p>Each NoSQL database claims to be optimal for certain use cases. Although few of them would fit the requirements to be a general-purpose database management system, they all leverage a few common themes across the spectrum of NoSQL systems.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will visit some of the broad categories of NoSQL database management systems. We will discuss the primary drivers that initiated the migration to NoSQL database systems and how such databases solved specific business needs that led to their widespread adoption, and conclude with a few hands-on NoSQL exercises.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Why NoSQL?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The term NoSQL generally means <em>Not Only SQL</em>: that is, the underlying database has properties that are different to those of common and traditional database systems. As such, there is no clear distinction that qualifies a database as NoSQL, other than the fact that they do not provide the characteristics of ACID compliance. As such, it would be helpful to understand the nature of ACID properties that have been the mainstay of database systems for many decades, as well as discuss, in brief, the significance of BASE and CAP, two other terminologies central to databases today.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The ACID, BASE, and CAP properties</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's first proceed with ACID and SQL.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">ACID and SQL</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>ACID stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomicity</strong>: This indicates that database transactions either execute in full or do not execute at all. In other words, either all transactions should be committed, that is, persisted in their entirety, or not committed at all. There is no scope for a partial execution of a transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: The constraints on the data, that is, the rules that determine data management within a database, will be consistent throughout the database. Different instances will not abide by rules that are any different to those in other instances of the database.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: This property defines the rules of how concurrent operations (transactions) will read and write data. For example, if a certain record is being updated while another process reads the same record, the isolation level of the database system will determine which version of the data would be returned back to the user.</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong>: The durability of a database system generally indicates that committed transactions will remain persistent even in the event of a system failure. This is generally managed by the use of transaction logs that databases can refer to during recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader may observe that all the properties defined here relate primarily to database transactions. A <strong>transaction</strong> is a unit of operation that abides by the aforementioned rules and makes a change to the database. For example, a typical cash withdrawal from an ATM may have the following logical pathway:</p>
<ol>
<li>User withdraws cash from an ATM</li>
<li>The bank checks the current balance of the user</li>
<li>The database system deducts the corresponding amount from the user's account</li>
<li>The database system updates the amount in the user's account to reflect the change</li>
</ol>
<p>As such, most databases in popular use prior to the mid-1990s, such as Oracle, Sybase, DB2, and others, were optimized for recording and managing transactional data. Until this time, most databases were responsible for managing transactional data. The rapid growth of the internet in the mid-90s led to new types of data that did not necessarily require the strict ACID compliance requirements. Videos on YouTube, music on Pandora, and corporate email records are all examples of use cases where a a transactional database does not add value beyond simply functioning as a technology layer for storing data.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The BASE property of NoSQL</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By the late 2000s, data volume had surged and it was apparent that a new alternative model was required in order to manage the data. This new model, called BASE, became a foundational topic that replaced ACID as the preferred model of database management systems.</p>
<p><strong>BASE</strong> stands for <strong>B</strong>asically <strong>A</strong>vailable <strong>S</strong>oft-state <strong>E</strong>ventually consistency. This implies that the database is <em>basically</em>Â available for use most of the time; that is, there can be periods during which the services are unavailable (and hence additional redundancy measures should be implemented). <em>Soft-state</em> means that the state of the system cannot be guaranteed - different instances of the same data might have different content as it may not have yet captured recent updates in another part of the cluster. Finally, <em>eventually</em> consistent implies that although the database might not be in the same state at all times, it will eventually get to the same state; that is, become <em>consistent</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The CAP theorem</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First introduced in the late 1990s by Eric Allen Brewer, the CAP theorem categorizes the constraints, or more generally the characteristics, of distributed database systems. In brief, the CAP theorem postulates that strictly speaking, database systems can guarantee only two of the three properties defined by CAP, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: The data should be consistent across all instances of the database and hence, when queried, should provide a coherent result across all nodes</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Irrespective of the state of any individual node, the system will always respond with a result upon a query being executed (whether or not it is the most recent commit)</li>
<li><strong>Partition tolerance</strong>: This implies that when nodes are separated across a network, the system should continue to function normally even if any node loses interconnectivity to another node</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be evident from this that, since in a cluster nodes will be connected over a <em>network</em> which, by nature can be disrupted, partition tolerance has to be guaranteed in order for the system to continue performing normally. In this case, the contention lies with choosing between consistency and availability. For example, if the system has to be consistent; that is, show the most recent commit across all nodes, all the nodes cannot be <em>available</em> all at the same time as some nodes might not have the most recent commit. In this case, a query on a new update will not execute until all nodes have been updated with the new data. In case of availability, in similar terms, we cannot guarantee consistency, since to be available at all times means that some nodes will not have the same data as another node if a new update has not been written onto the respective node.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of confusion as well as contention between deciding on whether to ensure consistency or to ensure availability, and as such databases have been categorized as being either <strong>CP</strong> or <strong>AP</strong>. For the purpose of this exercise, we need not get caught up in the terminologies as that would lead to a rather abstract and philosophical discussion. The information on the aforementioned terminologies has been primarily provided to reflect upon some of the foundational theories driving the development of databases.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The need for NoSQL technologies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>While most database systems were initially designed to manage transactions, the growth of internet-related technologies and new types of data that did not require the strict puritan nature of transactional systems necessitated the development of alternative frameworks.</p>
<p>For instance, storing the following types of data does not necessarily require a complex <em>transactional database</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>Media such as audio/video files</li>
<li>Social network messages</li>
<li>Website HTML pages</li>
<li>Many others</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the increase in users, and as a consequence, data volume, signaled the need for developing more robust architectures with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalable to manage ever increasing data volume</li>
<li>Leverage commodity hardware to decrease dependency on expensive hardware</li>
<li>Provide distributed processing capability across multiple nodes to process large-scale datasets</li>
<li>Be fault-tolerant/provide high availability to handle node and site failures</li>
</ul>
<p>Scalable implies that the system can accommodate the increase in data volume by increasing the number of nodes, namely, by scaling horizontally. Further, increasing the number of nodes should have minimal impact on the performance of the system.</p>
<p>Fault-tolerant implies that the system should be able to handle node failures, which won't be uncommon in a large distributed system with hundreds if not thousands of nodes.</p>
<p>This led to the development of various groundbreaking and influentialÂ systems, of which perhaps the most notable were Google Bigtable and Amazon Dynamo.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Google Bigtable</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Bigtable was a project that was initiated in 2004Â to manage both scalability and performance of the data used for various projects at Google. The seminal paper that describes the characteristics of the system was released in 2006 (<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf">https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf</a>)Â titled <em>Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data</em>. In essence, Bigtable was a <em>column-store</em> (more on this later) where each value could be uniquely identified using a row key, a column key, and a timestamp. It was one of the first mainstream databases that epitomized the benefits of storing data in a columnar format rather than using the more common row-based layout. Although columnar databases such as kdb+ and Sybase IQ existed prior to Bigtable, the use of the method by an industry leader to manage petabyte-scale information brought the concept into the limelight.</p>
<p>The official site of Bigtable summarizes the key-value proposition:</p>
<p>Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput, so it's a great choice for both operational and analytical applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Bigtable, several other NoSQL databases adopted the convention of columnar data layout; most notably HBase and Accumulo, which are both Apache projects.</p>
<p>The Bigtable solution is today available for use at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/</a> where it can be purchased on a subscription basis. The fee for smaller amounts of data is quite nominal and reasonable, whereas larger installations would require more extensive implementations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Amazon Dynamo</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Shortly after Google announced Bigtable, Amazon followed with the announcement of its internal Dynamo database at the 21st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles held in October, 2007 (<a href="http://www.sosp2007.org" target="_blank">http://www.sosp2007.org</a>).</p>
<p>In the paper, now available on Werner Vogels' site at <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf</a>, Amazon described a key-value store called Dynamo that was used to power some of Amazon's most critical internal services such as S3 on AWS. The paper brought to bear some key concepts such as key-value storage, consistent hashing, and vector clocks, among others, that were implemented in Dynamo.</p>
<p>Thus, Dynamo offered an alternative to Bigtable's columnar storage for large-scale datasets by introducing a fundamentally different method that leveraged key-value associations.</p>
<p>In the next few sections, we will discuss the various types of NoSQL technologies and how each of them has characteristics that make them optimal for certain use cases. NoSQL has ushered in a paradigm shift in how we treat databases, and has provided a much-needed alternative view to data management at a scale that was not feasible previously.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">NoSQL databases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In our discussion of NoSQL types and databases, we will primarily focus on the following characteristics of NoSQL databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-memory databases</li>
<li>Columnar databases</li>
<li>Document-oriented databases</li>
<li>Key-value databases</li>
<li>Graph databases</li>
<li>Other NoSQL types and summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Most types of NoSQL used in the industry today fall into one or more of these categories. The next few sections will discuss the high-level properties of each of these NoSQL offerings, their main advantages, and products in the market that fall into the respective categories.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">In-memory databases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>In-memory databases</strong>, as the name implies, leverage the computer memory; that is, the RAM, to store datasets. Before we look into how in-memory databases work, it would be worthwhile to recollect how data transfer happens in a typical computer:</p>
<div><img height="53" width="324" src="img/6a7357ec-76ba-4ba4-a9b8-957b76539cb5.png"/></div>
<p>Simple Data Flow Computer Hierarchy</p>
<p>As shown in the preceding image, data traverses from disk to memory to the CPU. This is a very high-level generalization of the exact process as there are conditions under which the CPU does not need to send an instruction to read data from memory (such as when the data is already present in the CPU L2 Cache - a part of the CPU that contains memory reserved for caching data), but fundamentally the process is linear between the CPU, RAM, and disk.</p>
<p>Data that is stored on disk can be transferred to the memory at a certain rate that is dependent on the I/O (Input/Output) throughput of the disk. It takes approximately 10-20 milliseconds (ms) to access data from disk. While the exact number varies depending on the size of the data, the minimum seek time (time for the disk to find the location of the data) in itself is approximately 10-15 ms. Compare this with the time it takes to fetch data from memory, which is approximately 100 nanoseconds. Finally, it takes approximately 7 ns to read data from the CPU L2 Cache.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, the disk access time of 15 milliseconds, namely, 15,000,000 nanoseconds is 150,000 times <em>slower</em> than the time it takes to access data from memory. In other words, data that is already present in memory can be read at an astounding 150 thousand times faster relative to disk. This is essentially true of reading random data. The time to read sequential data is arguably less sensational, but still nearly an order of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>If the disk and RAM were represented as cars, the RAM <em>car</em> would have gone all the way to the moon and be on its way back in the time it would take the disk car to go barely two miles. That is how large the difference is.</p>
<p>Hence, it is natural to conclude from this that if the data were stored in RAM, especially in the case of larger datasets, the access time would be dramatically lower, and consequently the time to process the data (at least on the I/O level) would be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Traditionally, all data in terms of databases was stored on disk. With the advent of the internet, the industry started leveraging <em>memcached,</em> which provided a means to store data in key-value pairs in memory via an API. For example, it was, and still is, common for MySQL databases to leverage the memcached API to cache objects in memory to optimize read speeds as well as reduce the load on the primary (MySQL) database.</p>
<p>However, as data volumes started to increase, the complexity of using the database and memcached method started to take it's toll, and databases that were exclusively designed to store data in memory (and sometimes both on disk and in memory) were being developed at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>As a result, in-memory databases such as Redis started replacing memcached as the fast cache store for driving websites. In the case of Redis, although the data would be held in memory as key-value pairs, there was an option to persist the data on disk. This differentiated it from solutions such as memcached that were strictly memory caches.</p>
<p>The primary drivers of the move towards in-memory databases can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complexity of managing increasing volumes of data such as web traffic by the traditional, for example, MySQL + memcached combination</li>
<li>Reduced RAM costs, making it more affordable to purchase larger sizes</li>
<li>Overall industry drive towards NoSQL technologies that led to increased focus and community participation towards the development of newer, innovative database platforms</li>
<li>Faster data manipulation in memory provided a means to reduce I/O overhead in situations that demanded ultra-fast, low-latency processing of data</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, some of the leading options for databases that provide in-memory capabilities in the industry include:</p>

<p>Note that some of these support hybrid architectures whereby data can reside in memory as well as on disk. In general, data would be transferred from memory to disk for persistence. Also, note that some commercial in-memory databases offer community editions that can be downloaded and used at no charge within the terms of the licenses applicable to the respective solution. In these cases, they are both open source as well as commercial.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Columnar databases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Columnar databases have existed since the 90s, but came to prominence after the release of Google Bigtable as mentioned earlier. They are, in essence, a method of storing data that is optimized for querying very large volumes of data in a fast and efficient manner relative to row-based/tuple-based storage.</p>
<p>The benefits of columnar databases, or more concretely storing each column of data independently, can be illustrated with a simple example.</p>
<p>Consider a table consisting of 100 million household addresses and phone numbers. Consider also a simple query that requires the user to find the number of households in the state of New York, in the city of Albany, built after 1990. We'll create a hypothetical table to illustrate the difference in querying the data row by row versus column by column.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware characteristics</strong>:</p>
<p>Average disk read speed: 200 MB per second</p>
<p><strong>Database characteristics</strong>:</p>
<p>Table name: <kbd>housedb</kbd></p>
<ul>
<li>Total rows = 100 million</li>
<li>Total rows with State NY = Two million</li>
<li>Total rows with State NY and City Albany = 10,000</li>
<li>Total rows with State NY and City Albany and YearBuilt &gt; 1990 = 500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data size</strong>:</p>
<p>Let us assume that the size of each of the data of each row is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlotNumber, YearBuilt each = 8 bytes = total 16 bytes</li>
<li>Owner, Address, State and City each = 12 bytes = Total 48 bytes</li>
<li>Net size in bytes of each row = 16 + 48 = 64 bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the actual size will be higher, as there are several other considerations such as indexing and other table optimizations and related overheads that we won't consider here for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>We will also assume that the columnar database maintains an implicit row index that permits querying the data at certain indices in each column <em>vector</em>.</p>
<p>The following table shows the first 4 records:</p>

<p>The query we will run against this dataset is as follows:</p>
<pre>select * from housedb where State like 'NY' and City like 'Albany' and YearBuilt &gt; 1990 </pre>
<p><strong>Scenario A: Searching row by row</strong></p>
<p>In the first scenario, if we did a naÃ¯ve row-by-row search, since the data for each column is not stored separately, but the data for each row is scanned, we would have to query across:</p>
<p>100 million * 64 bytes (size of each row in bytes) = 6,400 million bytes = approximately 6000 MB of data</p>
<p>At a disk read speed of say, 200 MBps, this means it would take approximately 6000 / 200 = 30 seconds to read all the records to find the matching entries.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B: Searching column by column</strong></p>
<p>Assuming each column of data resides in individual files representing the respective columns, we will look each where clause individually:</p>
<pre>select * from housedb where State like 'NY' and City like 'Albany' and YearBuilt &gt; 1990 </pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Where clause part 1</strong>: <kbd>where State like 'NY'</kbd></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The State column, as described earlier, has 100 million entries each of size 12 bytes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In this case, we only need to search across:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">100 million * 12 bytes = 1,200 million bytes = 1,000 MB of data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">At a data read rate of 200 MBps, this would take 200 MB, and it would take 1000 / 200 = 5 seconds to read the column of data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This returns two million records (as noted earlier database characteristics)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Where clause part 2</strong>: <kbd>City like 'Albany'</kbd></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In the preceding step, we had narrowed our window of search to two million records that satisfied the criteria of State NY. In the second where clause step, now, we need not query across all 100 million records. Instead, we can simply look at the two million records that satisfied the criteria to determine which ones belong to City Albany.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In this case, we only need to search across:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>2 million * 12 bytes = 24 million bytes = approximately 20 MB of data</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">At a data read rate of 200 MBps, this would take 0.1 seconds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This returns 10,000 records (as noted earlier in Database Characteristics).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Where clause part 3</strong>: <kbd>YearBuilt &gt; 1990</kbd></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In the preceding step, we further narrowed our window of search to 10,000 records fulfilling both the criteria of State NY and City Albany. In this step, we will query 10,000 records in the YearBuilt column to find which ones fulfil the criteria of YearBuilt &gt; 1990.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In this case, we only need to search across:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>10,000 * 16 bytes = 160,000 bytes = approximately 150 KB of data</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">At a data read rate of 200 MBps, this would take 0.00075 seconds, which we can round to zero seconds.</p>
<p>Hence, the net time spent in querying across the data was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where clause part 1: <kbd>where State like 'NY'</kbd> - five seconds</li>
<li>Where clause part 2: <kbd>City like 'Albany'</kbd> - 0.1 seconds</li>
<li>Where clause part 3: <kbd>YearBuilt &gt; 1990</kbd> - zero seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Net time taken to read the data = 5.1 seconds.</p>
<p>Important: Note that the actual read or more specifically, scan performance, depends on various other factors. The <strong>size of the tuple</strong> (row), the time to reconstruct the tuple (<strong>tuple reconstruction</strong>), <strong>bandwidth of memory</strong> (how fast data can be read into the CPU from Main Memory, and so on), <strong>cache line size</strong> and other factors. In practice, there would be various levels of abstractions due to which the actual performance may be slower. Further there are other considerations such as hardware architecture and parallel operations that can affect positively or otherwise the overall performance. These topics are more advanced and require dedicated reading.Â The analysis here focuses exclusively on the disk I/O, which is one of the critical aspects of overall performance at a high-level.</p>
<p>The preceding example demonstrates the benefits of querying data that has been stored in columns from a query performance or efficiency perspective based on the size of the data. There is also another benefit offered by columnar data, which is that it allows storage of tables that may have arbitrary schema in columns.</p>
<p>Consider the first four rows of the prior table. If, for example, we had missing information in some of the rows, that would lead to sparse columns:</p>

<p>A third and very important benefit offered by columnar databases is the ability to retrieve data based on three keys: a row key, a column key, and a timestamp that uniquely identifies each record, permitting very fast access to the data in question.</p>
<p>For example, since the Owner field can change when the property (PlotNumber) is sold, we can add another field that denotes the date of the record; that is, the date that the record corresponds to. This would allow us to distinguish among properties that had a change of ownership whilst all the other data remained the same:</p>

<p>Since there can be multiple records for each PlotNumber to accommodate change of ownership, we can now define three keys that could uniquely identify each cell of data in each record, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Row key: <kbd>PlotNumber</kbd></li>
<li>Column key: The column name</li>
<li>Timestamp key: <kbd>RecordDate</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Each cell in each record in the table will thus have a unique three-value pair that distinguishes it from the other cells.</p>
<p>Databases such as Bigtable, Cassandra, and others employ this method to perform data analysis at scale both expeditiously and efficiently.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Document-oriented databases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Document-based or document-oriented</strong> databases became prominent as a means of storing data that had variable structures; that is, there was no fixed schema that each record would fit into all the time. Additionally, the document may have both a structured as well as an <em>unstructured</em> part.</p>
<p>Structured data is, in essence, data that can be stored in a tabular format such as in a spreadsheet. Data stored in Excel spreadsheets or MySQL tables all belong to the class of structured datasets. Data that cannot be represented in a strict tabular format such as books, audio files, video files, or social network messages are considered unstructured data. As such, in document-oriented databases, we will primarily work with structured and unstructured text data.</p>
<p>An intuitive explanation of data that can contain both structured and unstructured text can be found in the example of a <strong>phone diary</strong>. Although these have become increasingly rare with the growth of digital data storage, many of us would remember a time when phone numbers were written in pocketbooks. The following image shows how we store data in a phone diary:</p>
<div><img height="122" width="341" src="img/1c2e56c2-7734-46a1-9bf9-4e35cd49d90a.png"/></div>
<p>Address Book (Semi-Structured Dataset)</p>
<p>In the preceding example, the following fields can be considered as structured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Tel and Fax</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">There is a line underneath the Address field where the user can enter arbitrary information, for example,Â met at a conference in 2015, works at company abc. This is essentially a note that the diary keeper wrote when entering the specific information. Since there is no defining characteristic of a free-form field such as this, it could also contain information such as a second phone number, or an alternative address and other information. This would qualify as an unstructured text.</p>
<p>Further, since the other fields are not interdependent, a user may write the address but not the phone number, or the name and phone number but not the address.</p>
<p>A document-oriented database, by virtue of its ability to store schema-free data; that is, data that does not conform to any fixed schema such as fixed columns with fixed datatypes, would hence be an appropriate platform to store this information.</p>
<p>As such, since a phone diary contains a much smaller volume of data, in practice, we could store it in other formats, but the necessity for document-oriented datasets becomes apparent when we are working with large-scale data containing both structured and unstructured information.</p>
<p>Using the example of a phone diary, the data could be stored in a document-oriented dataset in JSON format, as follows:</p>
<pre>( 
 { 
   "name": "John", 
   "address": "1 Main St.", 
   "notes": "Met at conference in 2015", 
   "tel": 2013249978, 
 }, 
 { 
   "name": "Jack", 
   "address": "20 J. Blvd", 
   "notes": "Gym Instructor", 
   "tel": 2054584538, 
   "fax": 3482274573 
 } 
) </pre>
<p><strong>JSON</strong>, which stands for <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>N</strong>otation, provides a means of representing data in a portable text-based key-value pair format. Today, data in JSON is ubiquitous across the industry and has become the standard in storing data that does not have a fixed schema. It is also a great medium to exchange structured data, and as such is used for such datasets frequently.</p>
<p>The preceding illustration provides a basic example to convey how document-oriented databases work. As such, it is a very simple and hopefully intuitive example. In practice, document-oriented databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB are used to store gigabytes and terabytes of information.</p>
<p>For example, consider a website that stores data on users and their movie preferences. Each user may have multiple movies they have watched, rated, recommended, movies that they have added to their wishlist, and other such artifacts. In such a case, where there are various arbitrary elements in the dataset, many of which are optional and many of which might contain multiple values (for example, multiple movies recommended by a user), a JSON format to capture information becomes optimal. This is where document-oriented databases provide a superior and optimal platform to store and exchange data.</p>
<p>More concretely, databases such as MongoDB store information in BSON format - a binary version of JSON documents that have additional optimizations to accommodate datatypes, Unicode characters, and other features to improve upon the performance of basic JSON documents.</p>
<p>A more comprehensive example of a JSON document stored in MongoDB could be data stored about airline passengers that contains information on numerous attributes specific to individual passengers, for example:</p>
<pre>{ 
   "_id" : ObjectId("597cdbb193acc5c362e7ae96"), 
   "firstName" : "Rick", 
   "age" : 66, 
   "frequentFlyer" : ( 
          "Delta" 
   ), 
   "milesEarned" : ( 
          88154 
   ) 
} 
{ 
   "_id" : ObjectId("597cdbb193acc5c362e7ae97"), 
   "firstName" : "Nina", 
   "age" : 53, 
   "frequentFlyer" : ( 
          "Delta", 
          "JetBlue", 
          "Delta" 
   ), 
   "milesEarned" : ( 
          59226, 
          62025, 
          27493 
   ) 
} </pre>
<p>Each entry is uniquely identified by the <kbd>_id</kbd> field, which allows us to directly query information relevant to the specific user and retrieve data without having to query across millions of records.</p>
<p>Today, document-oriented databases are used to store a diverse range of datasets. Examples include the use of such Â the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log files and log file-related information</li>
<li>Articles and other text-based published materials</li>
<li>Geolocation data</li>
<li>User/user account-related information</li>
<li>Many more use cases that are optimal for document/JSON based storage</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Key-value databases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Key-value databases</strong> operate on the principle of structuring data as pairs of values corresponding to keys. To highlight the benefits of key-value databases, it would help to revisit the significance of hash maps, a common term prevalent in computer science to specify a unique data-structure that provides a constant-time lookup for key pairs.</p>
<p>An intuitive example for a hash table is as follows:</p>
<p>Consider a collection of 500 books and five bookcases. Each bookcase has five shelves. The books can be placed in an arbitrary order, but that would make it incredibly difficult to find a specific book and you may need to go through hundreds of books before locating the one you need. One method of categorizing the books would be to assign ranges of letters to each of the bookshelves, for example, A-E, F-J, K-O, P-T, U-Z, and use the first letter of the name of the book to assign it to a specific shelf. However, suppose you have a disproportionate number of books that start with the letters A-E. This means that the case assigned for A-E would have a much higher number of books relative to the other ones.</p>
<p>A more elegant alternative could be to assign a value to each of the books and use the respective value to determine which bookcase or bookshelf the book belongs to. To assign a number, a specific value to each book, we could sum up the numbers corresponding to each letter of the title of the book using a range of 1-26 for the letters A-Z respectively:</p>
<div><img height="73" width="286" src="img/57f7faff-1435-44a3-978a-116c059ef15e.png"/></div>
<p>Our Simple Hash Map</p>
<p>Since we have five bookcases, each with five shelves, we have a total of 25 shelves. One method of allocating a book to a specific shelf would be to take the numeric value of the book obtained by summing the letters in the title and dividing the value by 26. Any number, when divided by 25, will yield a remainder between 0-25; that is, 26 unique values. We can use this value then to assign the book to a particular shelf. This then becomes our self-created hash function.</p>
<p>Of the 25 shelves, each of them is now assigned a numeric value corresponding to the values 0-25 respectively, with the last shelf being assigned the values 24 and 25. For example, shelf zero is assigned to store books whose numeric value divided by 26 yields zero, shelf one is assigned to store books whose numeric value divided by 26 yields one, and shelf 25 is assigned to store books whose numeric value divided by 26 yields 24 or 25.</p>
<p>An example will help to illustrate this concept more concretely.</p>
<p>Book name: <strong>HAMLET</strong></p>
<p>Numeric value of title:</p>
<div><img height="113" width="46" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1193 image-border" src="img/eb17fd9d-b49f-409b-989b-963f5b7f7594.png"/></div>
<p>Hash values</p>
<p>Sum total of the numeric value = 8 + 1 + 13 + 12 + 5 + 20 = 59</p>
<p>Divide number by 26 = 2, remainder seven</p>
<p>Hence, the book is assigned to shelf number seven.</p>
<p>We have essentially found a way to methodically assign a shelf to each individual book, and because we have a fixed rule, when a new request for a book arrives, we can find it almost instantaneously since we will know the shelf corresponding to the book.</p>
<p>The preceding method illustrates the concept of hashing, and in practice, we would use a hash function that would find a unique value for each book, and assuming we could get an arbitrary number of bookshelves and slots in which we can place the books, we could simply use the plain numeric value of the book to identify which shelf it would belong to.</p>
<p>There would be cases where two books would have the same numeric value, and in those cases we could stack the books in the slot corresponding to the number. In computer science, this effect of multiple values corresponding to a key is known as a collision, and in those cases we would assign multiple items by means of a list or similar datatype.</p>
<p>In real-life use cases, we have much more complex items to work with than the simple example of books. Generally, we'd use more complex hash functions that lower the chance of collision and accordingly assign the key-value pair. The data would be stored in a contiguous array in memory and hence, when a request for a certain key arrived, we could instantaneously find the value by using the hash function to identify the location in memory where the data resides.</p>
<p>Hence, using key-value pairs to store data can be immensely powerful because the time to retrieve information corresponding to a key can be very fast as there is no need to search through a long list to identify a matching key.</p>
<p>Key-value databases employ the same principle of assigning unique keys to each record, and the data corresponding to each key is stored in the corresponding location. In our discussion of MongoDB, we saw that records were assigned a certain key identified by the <kbd>_id</kbd> value in each record. In practice, we could use this value to retrieve the corresponding data in constant time.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, memcached used to be the preferred method to store data in key-value pairs for web services that required very fast access to frequently used data. In essence, it served as a memory cache to store temporary information. With the advent of NoSQL databases, new platforms that extended the limited use case of memcached became prominent. Solutions such as Redis offered not only the ability to store data in key-value pairs in memory, but also the ability to persist the data on disk. In addition, these key-value stores supported horizontal scaling, which permitted the distribution of key-value pairs across hundreds of nodes.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of key-value storage was that the data could not be queried with the same flexibility as standard databases, which supported multiple levels of indexing and a more richer set of SQL commands. Nevertheless, the benefits of constant time lookup implied that for use cases that required a key-value structure, there were few other solutions that were comparable in both performance and efficiency. For instance, a shopping website with thousands of users could store user profile information in a key-value database and be able to look up individual information by simply applying a hash function corresponding to, for example, the user ID.</p>
<p>Today, key-value databases use a variety of methods to store data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSTables</strong>: A file of sorted key-value pairs represented as strings (and directly mapped to the <strong>Google File System</strong> (<strong>GFS</strong>)).</li>
<li><strong>B-trees</strong>: Balanced trees where values are identified by traversing along leaves/nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Bloom filters</strong>: A more optimal key-value method used when the number of keys is high. It uses multiple hash functions to set the bit-value to one in an array corresponding to keys.</li>
<li><strong>Shards</strong>: A process involving partitioning data across multiple nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well known key-value databases include:</p>

<p><strong>Graph databases</strong> provide an efficient representation of data with records that have inter-relationships. Typical examples are your social network friend list, LinkedIn contacts, Netflix movie subscribers. By leveraging optimized algorithms for searching on tree-based/graph data structures, graph databases can locate information in a novel manner relative to other NoSQL solutions. In such a structure, discrete information and properties are represented as leaves, edges, and nodes.</p>
<p>The following image shows an atypical representation of a network that can be queried to discover or find complex inter-relationships using a graph database. In practice, production graph databases contain millions of nodes:</p>

<p>Graph Database</p>
<p>Although they are not as prevalent as other types of NoSQL database, graph-based platforms are used for business-critical areas. For instance, credit card companies use graph databases to find new products that an individual cardholder may be interested in by querying across millions of datapoints to assess purchasing behavior of other cardholders with similar purchasing patterns. Social network websites use graph databases to compute similarity scores, provide friend suggestions, and other related metrics.</p>

<p>A question often asked is whether there is one NoSQL database that is optimal for all use cases. While the databases can have multiple features that support numerous elements of NoSQL systems (generally known as multi-modal databases), in practice, a single solution that performs universally well across a broad set of use cases is rare. In real-world use cases, companies generally implement more than one solution to meet data mining needs. In the next section, we will complete a few hands-on exercises with real-world datasets using NoSQL solutions discussed in this chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Analyzing Nobel Laureates data with MongoDB</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the first exercise, we will use <strong>MongoDB</strong>, one of the leading document-oriented databases, to analyze Nobel Laureates from 1902-present. MongoDB provides a simple and intuitive interface to work with JSON files. As discussed earlier, JSON is a flexible format that allows representing data using a structured approach.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">JSON format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Consider the following table:</p>
<table class="MsoTableGrid">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Firstname</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Lastname</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Information</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>John</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>15</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Subject: History, Grade B</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Jack</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>18</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Subject: Physics, Grade A</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Jill</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>17</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Subject: Physics, Grade A+</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The Information field contains a column containing multiple values categorized under Subject and Grade. Such columns that contain multiple data are also known as columns with nested data.</p>
<p>Portability has been an important aspect of transferring data from one system to another. In general, ODBC connectors are used to transfer data between database systems. Another common format is CSV files with the data represented as comma-separated values. CSV files are optimal for structured data that doesn't contain more complex data structures such as nested values. In such cases, JSON provides an optimal and structured way to capture and preserve information using a key-value pair syntax.</p>
<p>In JSON representation, the table can be defined as follows:</p>
<pre>( 
   { 
      "Firstname":"John", 
      "Age":15, 
      "Information":{ 
         "Subject":"History", 
         "Grade":"B" 
      } 
   }, 
   { 
      "Firstname":"Jack", 
      "Age":18, 
      "Information":{ 
         "Subject":"Physics", 
         "Grade":"A" 
      } 
   }, 
   { 
      "Firstname":"Jill", 
      "Age":17, 
      "Information":{ 
         "Subject":"Physics", 
         "Grade":"A+" 
      } 
   } 
) </pre>
<p>Notice that theÂ <kbd>Information</kbd>Â key contains two keys, <kbd>Subject</kbd> and <kbd>Grade</kbd>, with each having a corresponding value.</p>
<p>Today, most product developers and vendors accommodate the ingestion of JSON-formatted data. Also, due to the simple manner in which complex relationships can be expressed as well as exchanged in text format, JSON has become immensely popular across the world in the developer community.</p>
<p>MongoDB captures data in JSON format. It internally stores them in BSONâan optimized binary representation of the JSON data.</p>

<p>MongoDB is supported on all major platforms such as Windows, Linux, and OS X platforms.</p>
<p>The details for installing MongoDB can be found on their official website at <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/">https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/</a>. Note that we will be using the MongoDB Community Edition.</p>
<p>For our exercise, we will re-use the Linux CentOS environment from our Cloudera Hadoop Distribution VM.</p>
<p>The exercise is however not dependent on the platform on which you install MongoDB. Once the installation has been completed, you can execute the commands indicated in this chapter on any other supported platform. If you have access to a separate Linux machine, you can use that as well.</p>
<p>We will visit some of the common semantics of MongoDB and also download two datasets to compute the highest number of Nobel Prizes grouped by continent. The complete dump of the Nobel Prize data on Nobel Laureates is available from <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org">nobelprize.org</a>. The data contains all the primary attributes of Laureates. We wish to integrate this data with demographic information on the respective countries to extract more interesting analytical information:</p>

### Using Comparison Operators 
### MongoDB allows users to chain multiple comparison operators
### Details on MongoDB operators can be found at: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/ 
 
# Find Nobel Laureates born in either India or Egypt using the $in operator
<strong>&gt; db.laureates.find ( { bornCountryCode: { $in: ("IN","EG") } } ) 
</strong> 
{ "_id" : ObjectId("597e202bcd8724f48de485f7"), "id" : "37", "firstname" : "Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata", "surname" : "Raman", "born" : "1888-11-07", "died" : "1970-11-21", "bornCountry" : "India", "bornCountryCode" : "IN", "bornCity" : "Tiruchirappalli", "diedCountry" : "India", "diedCountryCode" : "IN", "diedCity" : "Bangalore", "gender" : "male", "prizes" : ( { "year" : "1930", "category" : "physics", "share" : "1", "motivation" : "\"for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him\"", "affiliations" : ( { "name" : "Calcutta University", "city" : "Calcutta", "country" : "India" } ) } ) }

### Performing Aggregations is one of the common operations in MongoDB queries 
### MongoDB allows users to perform pipeline aggregations, map-reduce aggregations and single purpose aggregations 
 
### Details on MongoDB aggregations can be found at the URL 
### https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/ 
 
### Aggregation Examples 
 
### Count and aggregate total Nobel laureates by year and sort in descending order 
### Step 1: Use the $group operator to indicate that prize.year will be the grouping variable 
### Step 2: Use the $sum operator (accumulator) to sum each entry under a variable called totalPrizes 
### Step 3: Use the $sort operator to rank totalPrizes 
 
<strong>&gt; db.laureates.aggregate( 
  {$group: {_id: '$prizes.year', totalPrizes: {$sum: 1}}},  
  {$sort: {totalPrizes: -1}} 
);</strong> 
 
{ "_id" : ( "2001" ), "totalPrizes" : 15 } 
{ "_id" : ( "2014" ), "totalPrizes" : 13 } 
{ "_id" : ( "2002" ), "totalPrizes" : 13 } 
{ "_id" : ( "2000" ), "totalPrizes" : 13 } 
 
(...) 
 
### To count and aggregate total prizes by country of birth 
<strong>&gt; db.laureates.aggregate( 
  {$group: {_id: '$bornCountry', totalPrizes: {$sum: 1}}}, 
  {$sort: {totalPrizes: -1}} 
);</strong> 
 
{ "_id" : "USA", "totalPrizes" : 257 } 
{ "_id" : "United Kingdom", "totalPrizes" : 84 } 
{ "_id" : "Germany", "totalPrizes" : 61 } 
{ "_id" : "France", "totalPrizes" : 51 } 
...
 
### MongoDB also supports PCRE (Perl-Compatible) Regular Expressions 
### For more information, see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/regex 
 
### Using Regular Expressions: Find count of nobel laureates by country of birth whose prize was related to 'radiation' (as indicated in the field motivation under prizes) 
 
<strong>&gt; db.laureates.aggregate( 
  {$match : { "prizes.motivation" : /radiation/ }}, 
  {$group: {_id: '$bornCountry', totalPrizes: {$sum: 1}}},  
  {$sort: {totalPrizes: -1}} 
);</strong> 
 
{ "_id" : "USA", "totalPrizes" : 4 } 
{ "_id" : "Germany", "totalPrizes" : 2 } 
{ "_id" : "the Netherlands", "totalPrizes" : 2 } 
{ "_id" : "United Kingdom", "totalPrizes" : 2 } 
{ "_id" : "France", "totalPrizes" : 1 } 
{ "_id" : "Prussia (now Russia)", "totalPrizes" : 1 } 
 
 
#### Result: We see that the highest number of prizes (in which radiation was mentioned as a key-word) was the US 
 
### Interestingly, we can also do joins and other similar operations that allow us to combine the data with other data sources 
### In this case, we'd like to join the data in laureates with the data from country information obtained earlier 
### The collection country contains many interesting fields, but for this exercise, we will show how to find the total number of nobel laureates by continent 
 
### The Left Join 
 
### Step 1: Use the $lookup operator to define the from/to fields, collection names and assign the data to a field named countryInfo 
<br/>### We can join the field bornCountryCode from laureates with the field countryCode from the collection country 
<strong>&gt; db.laureates.aggregate( 
  {$lookup: { from: "country", localField: "bornCountryCode", foreignField: "countryCode", as: "countryInfo" }})</strong> 

{ "_id" : ObjectId("597e202bcd8724f48de485d4"), "id" : "1", "firstname" : "Wilhelm Conrad", "surname" : "RÃ¶ntgen", "born" : "1845-03-27", "died" : "1923-02-10", "bornCountry" : "Prussia (now Germany)", "bornCountryCode" : "DE", "bornCity" : "Lennep (now (..) "country" : "Germany" } ) } ), "countryInfo" : ( { "_id" : ObjectId("597e2f2bcd8724f48de489aa"), "continent" : "EU", "capital" : "Berlin", "languages" : "de", "geonameId" : 2921044, "south" : 47.2701236047002, ...
 
### With the data joined, we can now perform combined aggregations 
 
### Find the number of Nobel laureates by continent 
<strong>&gt; db.laureates.aggregate( 
  {$lookup: { from: "country", localField: "bornCountryCode", foreignField: "countryCode", as: "countryInfo" }}, 
  {$group: {_id: '$countryInfo.continent', totalPrizes: {$sum: 1}}}, 
  {$sort: {totalPrizes: -1}} 
);</strong> 
 
... ); 
{ "_id" : ( "EU" ), "totalPrizes" : 478 } 
{ "_id" : ( "NA" ), "totalPrizes" : 285 } 
{ "_id" : ( "AS" ), "totalPrizes" : 67 } 
...
This indicates that Europe has by far the highest number of Nobel Laureates.  </pre>
<p>There are many other operations that can be performed, but the intention of the prior section was to introduce MongoDB at a high level with a simple use case. The URLs given in this chapter contain more in-depth information on using MongoDB.</p>
<p>There are also several visualization tools in the industry that are used to interact with and visualize data stored in MongoDB collections using a point-and-click interface.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Tracking physician payments with real-world data</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Physicians and hospitals alike receive payments from various external organizations, such as pharmaceutical companies who engage sales representatives to not only educate practitioners on their products, but also provide gifts or payments in kind or otherwise. In theory, gifts or payments made to physicians are not intended to influence their prescribing behavior, and pharmaceutical companies adopt careful measures to maintain checks and balances on payments being made to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>In 2010, President Obama's signature <strong>Affordable Care Act</strong>Â (<strong>ACA</strong>), also known in popular parlance as Obamacare, went into effect. Alongside the ACA, a separate legislation known as the Sunshine Act made reporting items of monetary value (directly or indirectly) mandatory for pharmaceutical companies and other organizations. While such rules existed in the past, rarely were such rules available in the public domain. By making detailed payment records made to all physicians available publicly, the Sunshine Act introduced an unprecedented level of transparency in monetary dealings involving healthcare providers.</p>
<p>The data is freely available on the website of CMS Open Payments at <a href="https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov" target="_blank">https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The site provides an interface to query the data, but does not have any means to perform large-scale data aggregation. For example, if a user wanted to find the total payments made in the state of CT, there is no simple and easy way to run the query through the default web-based tool. An API that provides the functionality is available, but requires a degree of familiarity and technical knowledge to use effectively. There are third-party products that provide such facilities, but in most cases they are expensive, and end users cannot modify the software to their particular needs.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will develop a fast, highly efficient web-based application to analyze tens of millions of records that capture payments made to physicians in 2016. We will be using a combination of a NoSQL database, R, and RStudio to create the final product - the web-based portal through which end users can query the database in real time.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The technologies we will use to develop the application are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kdb+ NoSQL database: <a href="http://www.kx.com" target="_blank">http://www.kx.com</a></li>
<li>R</li>
<li>RStudio</li>
</ul>
<p>For the tutorial, I will be using the VM image we downloaded for our Hadoop exercise. The tools can also be installed on Windows, Mac, and other Linux machines. The choice of the VM is mainly to provide a consistent and local OS independent platform.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing kdb+, R, and RStudio</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A Packt Data Science VM download has been provided,Â which contains all the necessary software required for this chapter. However, if you prefer to install the software on your local machine instead, instructions, have been provided in the following sections. You can skip the installation sections and proceed directly to the section on <em>Developing the Open Payment Application.</em></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing kdb+</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>kdb+</strong> is a time-series, in-memory, columnar database that has been used in the financial industry for almost 20 years. It is one of the fastest database platforms available for performing large-scale data mining, but one that is not as well-known as other NoSQL tools due to the fact that it has been used almost exclusively by hedge funds and investment banks for most of its existence. In particular, due to its speed and low overhead in processing vast amounts of data, it is used by algorithmic trading desks that engage in high-frequency trading.</p>
<p>With kdb+, it is fairly simple to analyze tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of records on a laptop. The main constraints would be at a hardware level - such as the amount of memory, disk space, and CPU that is available to process the data. In this tutorial, we will install the free 32-bit edition of kdb+ available for non-commercial use.</p>
<p>kdb+ is not open source, but academic institutes can use the 64-bit license at no charge by writing to <kbd>academic@kx.com</kbd>.</p>
<p>There are certain key characteristics of kdb+ that make it very well suited to large-scale data analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-level implementation</strong>: The database is written in C, thus reducing common causes of performance issues with most contemporary NoSQL databases that rely heavily on Java, which implements multiple layers of abstraction to provide processing capabilities</li>
<li><strong>Architectural simplicity</strong>: The entire binary for the kdb+ database is about 500-600 KB. This is a fraction of the size of an MP3 song and can be easily downloaded even on a dial-up connection</li>
<li><strong>MapReduce</strong>: The database implements an internal MapReduce process that allows queries to execute across multiple cores simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>No installation</strong>: The database requires no system-level privileges and users can start using kdb+ with their user account on most systems</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise-ready</strong>: The database has been used for nearly 20 years and is a very mature product used in global enterprise environments for analysis of high-frequency trading data among otherÂ applications</li>
<li><strong>Wide availability of interfaces</strong>: The database has a wide range of interfaces for languages such as C, C++,C#, Java, R, Python, MATLAB, and others to allow easy integration with existing software</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The steps to install kdb+ are given as follows. Please note that if you are using the Packt Data Science VM, no additional installation is necessary. The instructions have been provided primarily for users who would like to install the software afresh.</p>
<p>Although the instructions are for Linux, the installation process is also quite simple for both Windows and Macs. The instructions herein are geared towards the Packt Data Science VM.

<p>Defining an application</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Â You'll get a notification that the <strong>Application Token</strong> has been created:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="234" width="474" class=" image-border" src="img/457be983-e31e-4bd4-9435-8509fdb84e4f.png"/></p>
<p>Creating the Application Token</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">The system will generate an <strong>App Token</strong>. Copy the <strong>App Token</strong>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="188" width="446" class=" image-border" src="img/0db9fc01-86f3-4a94-bb24-b8aed05f5c32.png"/></p>
<p>The Application Token</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, log in to the Packt Data Science VM as user packt and execute the following shell command after replacing the term <kbd>YOURAPPTOKEN</kbd> with the one that you were assigned (it will be a long string of characters/numbers). Note that for the tutorial, we will only download a few of the columns and restrict the data to only physicians (the other option is hospitals).</li>
</ol>
<p>You can reduce the volume of the data downloaded by reducing the value of the limit specified at the end of the command to a lower number. In the command, we have used <kbd>12000000</kbd> (12 million), which would let us download the entire 2016 dataset representing physician payments. The application will still work if, for example, you were to download only one million entries instead of the approximately 11-12 million records.</p>
<p>Note: Two approaches are shown below. One using the Token and the other without using the Token. Application Tokens allow users to have a higher throttling limit. More information can be found atÂ <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html">https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html</a></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating the frontend web portal</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>R Shiny</strong>, a package intended to make development of web-based applications simple, started gaining traction since it was introduced in around 2012-2013. In general, R developers tend not to be very frontend development savvy as their main areas of work would be related to statistics or similar disciplines.</p>
<p>As data science, as a profession and a mainstream activity became popular, the need to create sophisticated web-based applications became necessary as a means of delivering results to end users in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p>JavaScript, which had all but lost its original appeal, made a surprise comeback and soon enough the web world was abuzz with the release of various leading JavaScript packages for web development and visualization, such as D3, Angular, Ember, and others ever since 2010-2011.</p>
<p>But these were mostly used by seasoned JavaScript developers, few of whom were also proficient in R. Developing a solution that would help bridge the gap between JavaScript web-based application development and R programming became a necessity for R developers to showcase and share their work with a broader audience.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">R ShinyÂ platform for developers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>R Shiny introduced a platform for R developers to create JavaScript-based web applications without having to get involved, or, for that,Â matter even be proficient in JavaScript.</p>
<p>In order to build our application, we will leverage R Shiny and create an interface to connect to the CMS Open Payments data we set up in the prior section.</p>
<p>If you are using your own R installation (locally), you'll need to install a few R packages. Note that if you are using a Linux workstation, you may need to install some additional Linux packages. For example, in Ubuntu Linux, you'll need to install the following. You may already have some of the packages, in which case you'll receive a message indicating that no further changes were needed for the respective package:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo apt-get install software-properties-common libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev gdebi-core rlwrap</strong> </pre>
<p>If you are using the Packt Data Science VM, you can proceed directly to developing the application as these Linux packages have already been installed for you.</p>
<p>The Shiny application requires a few additional R packages to provide all its functionalities. Note that R packages are different from the Linux packages described previously. R packages, which number in the thousands, provide specialized functions for specific subject areas. For the web application, we will install a few R packages that will let us leverage some of the features in the web-based application.</p>
<p>The following steps outline the process of creating the web portal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to RStudio. If you are using the Packt Data Science VM, go toÂ <kbd>http://localhost:8787/auth-sign-in</kbd>. Log in with the user IDÂ <strong>packt</strong>Â and passwordÂ <strong>packt</strong>Â (same as user ID).</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that if you had installed RStudio locally, you'll not have a separate login screen. The instruction is purely for the Packt Data Science VM:</p>

<p>Logging into RStudio Server (Only for Packt VM)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you receive an error message stating that the site cannot be loaded, it may be due to the fact that the port forwarding has not been set up. To fix the issue, make the following changes:</p>

<p>In the prior sections, we have learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the datasets</li>
<li>Create the backend database</li>
<li>Create the code for the backend database</li>
<li>Set up RStudio</li>
<li>Create the R Shiny application</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the application, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start the Q application, make sure you are in the home directory. Type pwd and hit Enter. This will show the present working directory of <kbd>/home/packt</kbd> as shown in the coming image.</p>
</li>
<li>Next, type <kbd>q</kbd> and hit Enter.</li>
<li>At the <kbd>q</kbd> prompt, type in <kbd>\l cms.q</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Note that <kbd>cms.q</kbd> is the file we created in our earlier section when developing the Q application.</p>
<p>The script will load the database and return back to the <kbd>q)</kbd> prompt:</p>

<p>Putting it all together: Loading the CMS KDB+ Q Script in KDB+ Session</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Launch the CMS Open Payment application</li>
<li>In RStudio, open theÂ <kbd>app.R</kbd>Â file (which contains the R Code) and click on Run App at the top-right, shown as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>Running the RShiny Application</p>
<p>This will launch the web application, shown as follows:</p>

<p>The RShiny Application</p>
<p>We have now finished developing a complete CMS Open Payments application that allows the end user to filter, aggregate, and analyze the data. Now, you can run queries by selecting various options on the screen. There are two functionalities in the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filtering data (default view)</li>
<li>Aggregating data (you can switch to this option by selecting Aggregate Data from the Display Type menu)</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Applications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>A filtering example</strong>: To see payments made by a company for a certain drug in the state of NY:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" src="img/3be31cd1-a953-4cc6-a6ad-2e29e2071aeb.png"/></div>
<p>Using the RShiny Application</p>
<p>Note that the system processed 11 million records in 21 milliseconds, as shown in the header message. The name of the company and the product has been blanked out in the screenshot for privacy, but you are free to try out different options for both fields.</p>
<p>Note that in the default VM, we are using only one core with very limited memory, and the speed with which the data is processed using kdb+ even on a laptop with very limited resources easily exceeds the performance of many well-to-do commercial solutions.</p>
<div><p><strong>An aggregation example</strong>: To see total payments grouped by state, payment category, and payment nature for a specific company and product, select the options for the fields <em>Aggregate Data</em> and <em>Calculate Metrics</em>. Please note that the name of the company and the product have been hidden in the screenshot for privacy reasons only.</p>
<p>Note the message at the top that states:</p>
<p><img height="24" width="630" class=" image-border" src="img/5abd0a19-3bf8-45ff-a9aa-9d41ab2e3125.png"/></p>
<p>Log message indicating query and application performance</p>
<p>This indicates the speed with which the underlying kdb+ database processed the data. In this case, it filtered and <em>aggregated 11 million records in 22 milliseconds</em> for the given options.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This chapter introduced the concept of NoSQL. The term has gained popularity in recent years, especially due to its relevance and direct application to <strong>big data</strong> analytics. We discussed the core terminologies in NoSQL, their various types, and popular software used in the industry for such capabilities. We concluded with a couple of tutorials using MongoDB and kdb+.</p>
<p>We also built an application using R and R Shiny to create a dynamic web interface to interact with the data loaded in kdb+.</p>
<p>The next chapter will introduce another common technology in data science today, known as Spark. It is yet another toolkit that empowers data scientists across the world today.</p>

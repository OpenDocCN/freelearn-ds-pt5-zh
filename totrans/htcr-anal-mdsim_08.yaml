    score model commonly used in healthcare with the theory and features underlying
    machine learning models similar to those developed in [Chapter 7](d029d858-9c6e-4bf0-b793-87cdc4395e86.xhtml),
    *Making Predictive Models in Healthcare*. If you come from a data science background,
    this chapter will be a good introduction to some of the widely used clinical risk
    scores and will indicate which features should be included in your models, whether
    general or disease-specific. If you come from a healthcare background, this chapter
    will be a review of some of the clinical risk scores and will explain how machine
    learning algorithms can enhance traditional risk assessment.

    Learning Foundations*, healthcare is no stranger to complex risk factor assessments.
    For almost every major disease, one can find several risk-scoring models that
    are used widely by physicians to assess the risk of having a disease or suffering
    morbidity/mortality from that disease. When we use the term "risk score," we are
    largely referring to criterion tables, in which risk factors are allotted point
    values, and the points for all of the risk factors are summed to give an overall
    risk based on the total. These scoring systems are used widely in medicine; interestingly,
    many of them are based on research involving logistic regression models (similar
    to the one developed in [Chapter 7](d029d858-9c6e-4bf0-b793-87cdc4395e86.xhtml),
    *Making Predictive Models in Healthcare*). The crucial question of the last several
    decades is whether machine learning can improve our ability to predict whether
    an individual has or will have a disease, how much care that disease will require,
    and whether the patient will die from the disease in a certain time period.

    sections on several leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries
    for which risk scores have been developed. The covered entities include overall
    cardiovascular risk, congestive heart failure, cancer, and all-cause readmission.
    The first three entities are leading causes of mortality, and the fourth entity
    is a common way to measure quality in healthcare. We then explore the subsequent
    machine learning literature to see whether machine learning has improved the traditional
    risk assessment used for that disease. By the end of this chapter, you should
    have a thorough understanding of how machine learning can be used to improve disease
    prediction.

    leading cause of hospital admissions for healthcare professionals and accounts
    for up to 2% of total healthcare expenditures in developed countries (Tripoliti

    scores, the study's authors used the Cox proportional hazards regression, which
    is similar to logistic regression, except that instead of determining how variables
    are associated with a binary outcome, it determines how variables are related
    to the quantity of time before an event occurs. They even calculated the *C*-statistic
    of their risk score (analogous to the area under the curve, discussed in [Chapter
    3](46c83498-cb6e-45b4-ac39-6875a8d32400.xhtml), *Machine Learning Foundations*)
    which was 0.76 to 0.79\. This is a very good score that can be obtained just from
    a patient history, physical examination, and some simple blood tests.

    (Weng et al., 2017). It was a prospective study that monitored the electronic
    medical records of 378,256 patients from the year 2005 to 2015\. For each patient,
    they used data on the 8 risk factors included in the Framingham Risk Score, as
    well as 22 additional variables that were thought to be correlated with cardiovascular
    risk from previous literature and consultation with physicians. The 22 additional
    variables encompassed information such as socioeconomic status; history of other
    illnesses including kidney disease, arthritis, and atrial fibrillation; newer
    lab tests such as C-reactive protein and gamma-glutamyl transferase; and ethnicity.
    They trained four types of machine learning algorithms on the patient data – logistic
    regression, random forest, neural networks, and gradient-boosting machines. All
    four of the algorithms improved performance over the baseline risk prediction
    algorithm; in fact, the neural network algorithm predicted 355 more correct cases
    of cardiovascular events than the established algorithm. As they looked at the
    variables of top importance, while many resembled the Framingham criteria, many
    were new. Ethnicity appeared in the top three variables in all of the algorithms.
    Socioeconomic status (Townsend Deprivation Index) appeared in the top ten for
    all four algorithms. Chronic kidney disease was also found to be linked to cardiovascular
    risk. For cardiovascular risk, it is clear that machine learning has enriched
    our knowledge of predicting cardiac events.

- en: Cancer can be described as the growth and proliferation of abnormal cells. These
    cells differ from normal cells in their aggressive reproductive capabilities and
    their ability to starve normal cells from important resources such as blood and
    nutrients. Cancer is usually either benign, meaning that it is self-contained
    to a local area of the body, or malignant, meaning that it has the ability to
    spread to other bodily tissues. Malignant cancers almost always result in death
    if untreated, and many even when treated. The progression toward death depends
    on a number of factors, including the type of cancer, clinical stage of the cancer
    when detected, pathologic grade of the tumor, and clinical risk factors. Benign
    cancers aren't as problematic as malignant cancers, although they may cause symptoms
    and can still result in death (for example, a benign acoustic neuroma that causes
    high pressure in the brain). Treatment involves some combination of chemotherapy,
    radiotherapy, biological agents, and/or surgical resection of the tumor and possibly
    the surrounding tissue and organs.

    poorly; a systematic review of the literature for the performance of the Gail
    model for predicting breast cancer risk found AUCs that were typically between

    exam or self-breast exam. The sensitivity and specificity for breast exams vary
    widely according to age, breast density, and research setting; one study found
    that sensitivity can be as low as 57%, although the same study found the specificity
    to be 88% (Baines et al., 1989). Because a good screening test has a high sensitivity,
    there is a consensus that physical breast examination alone is not adequate for
    breast cancer screening.

    mammograms (see the following diagram showing a mammogram of the breast with a
    whitish area diagnosed as colloid carcinoma; National Cancer Institute, 1990)
    for women aged 50 and older, due to the high sensitivity (77% to 95%) and high
    specificity (94% to 97%) of mammograms in this age group combined with their low
    potential for causing patient harm (US Preventive Services Task Force, 2016).

    lymph node examination, and calcification characteristics. An artificial neural
    network consisting of 1,000 hidden layers was trained and the generated labels
    were compared to the true label of benign versus malignant. Eight radiologists
    also reviewed varying numbers of mammograms and classified the scan as benign
    versus malignant. The total AUC of the neural network was 0.965, while that of
    the radiologists was 0.939\. This study, combined with other studies we will read

    system or disease. However, it is becoming a problem of increasing importance
    in the healthcare world, since preventable hospital readmissions are a major cause
    of elevated healthcare expenditures in the United States and other countries.

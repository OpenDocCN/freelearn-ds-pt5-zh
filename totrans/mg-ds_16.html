<p class="p2">Technology choices have lasting consequences. A project's technology stack determines the functional and nonfunctional capabilities of your system, so it is critical to make thoughtful choices. The bidirectional link between technologies and requirements opens up an analytical approach for choosing between different technologies by matching their features against the project's needs. In this chapter, we will see how we can use software design practices to form project-specific technology stacks and see what technologies should constitute the core technology stack that's shared among all of your projects. We will also explore an approach that compares different technologies so that you can make a rational choice between apparently similar options.</p>
<p class="p2">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li3">Defining the elements of the technology stack</li>
<li class="li3">Choosing between core- and project-specific technologies</li>
<li class="li3">Comparing tools and products</li>
</ul>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Defining the elements of a technology stack</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p6">A technology stack is a set of tools that your team uses to deliver products and finish projects. When choosing technologies, you start by defining their goals and thoroughly documenting all the requirements. From there, you and your team can see what technologies will help you to reach the end goal.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p6">Shaping a technology stack goes toe-to-toe with designing software architecture, so the engineers on your team should start by drafting a system design that will meet everyone's requirements. Software architecture is a wide and deeply technical topic, so we won't discuss it in depth in this chapter. Instead, we will present an overview of the necessary steps when it comes to choosing the best technologies for reaching specific goals. Let's get started:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6">Collect the requirements and define the goals clearly.</li>
<li class="li6">Choose a set of architecture views for your project. An architecture view contains visual and textual descriptions of some of the aspects of the system. The most prominent examples of architecture views are as follows:
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li6"><strong>Infrastructure view</strong>:<strong> </strong>Represents the physical parts of the system. Servers, storage arrays, and networks are documented inside this view.</li>
<li class="li6"><strong>Component view</strong>: Represents the logical components of the software system that you are going to build. The component view should define the isolated parts of the system and the interfaces that they communicate through.</li>
<li class="li6"><strong>Deployment view</strong>: Matches the logical representation of the component view with the physical reality of the infrastructure view. The deployment view should describe how the system components will be delivered to the corresponding hardware.</li>
<li class="li6"><strong>Other views</strong>: Different methodologies for designing software architecture define many useful views. For example, the ArchiMate 2.1 specification defines 18 architecture views that can be useful for different stakeholders. For the sake of brevity, we will cover only the main views that can affect the technology stack and omit the others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li6">Define a list of necessary functions for technologies that you will use for the development and operations of your system based on the requirements and software design that has been produced by your team. Don't forget to include cross-cutting technologies that will optimize the experimentation, development, delivery, and operations of your system. Cross-cutting technologies may not help you find any specific functional requirements but will be beneficial to the project in general. Experimental tracking frameworks, data version control systems, and <strong>Continuous Integration</strong>/<strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>/<strong>CD</strong>) servers are all examples of cross-cutting technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p7">As an example, let's build a technology stack for a customer churn prediction system. Our customer has defined the following list of requirements for the churn prediction module. We'll omit the technical details so that we can focus on the overall process:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li7">Process the data from the marketing database. This contains customer information. The size of the dataset is under 5 GB of raw data.</li>
<li class="li7">Train the churn prediction model on a weekly basis, every Monday. We should consider customers that have made no purchases for a month as churned.</li>
<li class="li7">Notify the team about the potential customer churn by using remote API calls. The service should be available on business days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Decomposition classifies every requirement into two categories: <strong>functional requirement</strong> (<strong>FR</strong>) and <strong>nonfunctional requirement</strong> (<strong>NFR</strong>). FRs includes all the requirements that are related to the functions of the system that affect core use cases and end users. NFRs includes all the requirements that apply to the system in general and define a set of constraints in which the system will work. Service-level agreements and availability requirements are good examples of NFRs.</p>
<p>The team has decomposed customer requirements into the following list:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li7"><strong>FR</strong>:
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li7"><strong>FR1</strong>: The system must be integrated with the customer's marketing database.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>FR2</strong>: The system must provide a customer churn prediction model. We can consider customers that have made no purchases for a month as churned.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>FR3</strong>: The system must call a remote API to notify the marketing department about potential customer churn.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>FR4</strong>: The model should be executed every Monday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>NFR</strong>:
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li7"><strong>NFR1</strong>: The system should handle processing 5 GB of data every week.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>NFR2</strong>: The API should be available on business days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p7">Based on this requirements list, the team has come up with the following system design, which has been drawn in ArchiMate 2.1 notation using the Archi software (<a href="https://www.archimatetool.com/">https://www.archimatetool.com/</a>):</p>
<p class="p7 CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3ac1874f-587f-4e17-a53c-fc3f74c5f810.png" style="width:55.00em;height:25.42em;" width="1019" height="471"/><br/></p>
<p>The preceding diagram consists of two levels: the infrastructure and software implementation.</p>
<p>The software level describes the relationships between different components and services: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raw customer data: </strong>Represents the raw data that's used by the churn prediction system.</li>
<li><strong>Model training pipeline: </strong>Represents a set of data processing and model training steps, grouped as a software component.</li>
<li><strong>Model prediction pipeline: </strong>Represents the component that's responsible for taking trained models to make churn predictions and generate customer churn alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduler: </strong>Orchestrates the work of other components by running pipelines based on a schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Customer churn alerts:</strong> Notification events about potential customer churn.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing CRM system: </strong>The customer's CRM system, which has already been deployed and used in production.</li>
<li><strong>Notification API: </strong>A service that allows us to create notifications about customers inside the CRM system.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The infrastructure level, which describes the physical allocation of software to specific hardware resources, has three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing database server</strong></li>
<li><strong>Model server</strong></li>
<li><strong>CRM server</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The preceding software architecture diagram omits many technical details for the sake of simplicity since our goal is to demonstrate how to make technology choices. The core idea of the following text is not to deepen your knowledge of the vast area of software architecture, but to give you a general feel for the process where requirements flow into sound technology choices. Understanding this process can help you guide your team of experts toward an efficient technology stack choice. The project did not seem very complicated to the team, and the task was fairly standard for them. The team has decided to use a general set of cross-cutting technologies that they use for every project as a corporate standard:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7">Python as a programming language</li>
<li class="li7">Git for source version control</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>Data version control</strong> (<strong>DVC</strong>) for data version control</li>
<li class="li7">GitLab CI/CD as a CI/CD server</li>
<li class="li7">Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7">To implement FR, they have decided to use the following technologies:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><strong>FR1</strong>: The SQLAlchemy library for database access.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>FR2</strong>: scikit-learn as a machine learning library.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>FR3</strong>: Requests for API calls. The team has also decided to use a separate database to store prediction results and model execution logs.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>FR4</strong>: The team has decided to use cron (a popular Unix scheduler that can run commands based on a predefined scheduling table) as the main scheduling solution.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p7">To implement NFR, they have decided to do the following:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><strong>NFR1</strong>: Perform load tests and determine the minimum necessary server configuration for model training. From the team's previous experience, a virtual server with 8 CPU, 1 GB RAM, and 15 GB HDD should be sufficient, so they set this configuration as a baseline for tests.</li>
<li class="li7"><strong>NFR2</strong>: The team has decided to request more detailed information on API usage and ask how many requests they can expect per day. It turns out that the API will be executed up to 10 times a day, so a single API server should suffice for this availability requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7">In this section, we have explored how to develop a project-specific technology stack. However, there is another important dimension where technology choice matters: your team's expertise and skills. In the next section, we will look at the relationship between the team and project technology stacks.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Choosing between core- and project-specific technologies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p8">Technology choices should help with project requirement realization, but it is also crucial to take your team's expertise and capabilities into account, as well as the constraints. For example, if your team consists entirely of Python developers, choosing Julia as a primary programming language may be a bad idea, even if the team sees it as a better fit for the project:</p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li9">All of the team members will spend time learning a new language, practically destroying all productivity gains from using the technology.</li>
<li class="li9">The team's conclusions may be over-optimistic because of their lack of experience with the new technology.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p8">Those two risks abate if your team pursues a growth mindset and gains new knowledge continuously, but they never vanish completely.</p>
<p class="p8">The core expertise in your team puts limits on what technologies you can use in projects. If you want more options, it is important to develop a team technology stack separately. Continuous internal research processes should keep your core technology step up to date. Project-specific technology stacks can be formed by adapting the core technology stack for your project's requirements.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p8">We can view the internal technology research process as a separate long-running project, which is best managed by using Kanban:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li9">Someone on the team spots a potentially useful technology.</li>
<li class="li9">The experienced team members do a quick review of this technology. If the technology looks promising, they put it into the internal research backlog.</li>
<li class="li9">Once the team manager decides that some time can be invested in internal research processes, they start a backlog grooming session. There, the team prioritizes tasks in the backlog and enriches their definitions according to the <strong>specific measurable achievable relevant time-bound</strong> (<strong>SMART</strong>) criteria.</li>
<li class="li9">The assignee takes a single task from the backlog and tries to finish it as quickly as possible. If they encounter a blocking problem, it should be instantly reported and solved, preferably with the help of other team members.</li>
<li class="li9">Once the research has been done, the assignee reports the results in the form of a document or a talk so that the team can decide on whether they will include the technology in the core technology stack.</li>
<li class="li9">If the decision is positive, it is crucial to create an educational program for wider internal technology adoption. The main result of this task is to prepare a workshop, guide, instruction booklet, or some other educational material that new and existing team members can use to familiarize themselves with the technology.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p9">The core technology stack should not include overly specific technologies that are applicable to only a small set of projects. The sole purpose of this content is to help your team form a technological basis that solves the majority of requirements that arise in your projects. The more widely focused your team is, the more general the core technology stack should be. If the entire team is building a specific product, then project-specific and core technology stacks start to merge into a single entity. </p>
<p class="p9">The process of adapting the core technology stack into a new project is as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li9">Determine a set of project requirements.</li>
<li class="li9">See what requirements are satisfied by the core technology stack.</li>
<li class="li9">If some requirements are violated by the core technology stack, search for alternatives.</li>
<li class="li9">If some requirements are not met by the core technology stack, search for additions that can be integrated into the core technology stack.</li>
<li class="li9">At the end of the project, evaluate the new technologies that were added to the project and decide whether they are a good fit for the core technology stack.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p7">Using these processes, you can turn often chaotic and desire-driven technology choices into a consistent and logical series of steps that lead to meaningful decisions. However, even the most deliberate requirement decompositions may leave your team wondering which technology to choose because there are many intersections and alternatives between different frameworks, libraries, and platforms. In the next section, we will explore how we can choose from a variety of technologies.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Comparing tools and products</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p8"><em>Should we choose R or Python?</em> <em>What's better, TensorFlow or PyTorch?</em> A list of endless quarrels about which is the best X for doing Y can be found all over the internet. Those discussions are ceaseless simply because there is no silver bullet in the technology world. Every team of professionals has their specific use cases, which makes a certain technology choice work for them. There is no technology that will equally satisfy everyone.</p>
<p class="p8">X versus Y disputes often happen inside project teams, which is the most unproductive activity engineers can spend their time on. If you try to transition from X versus Y debates to searching for technologies that fit your specific needs (which are clearly stated, classified, and documented), you will get far more useful results in less time. Choosing the most modern or fashionable technologies is the closest analogy for playing Russian roulette for data scientists and software engineers. Let's explore how we can make thoughtful decisions about technology stacks.</p>
<p class="p8">To make meaningful technology choices, you need to make the process more systematic. First, you need to derive a set of comparison criteria that will allow you to benchmark different technologies and provide a template for research activities. These criteria should test different dimensions or groups of requirements that make the technology useful in your specific case.</p>
<p>Let's examine the specifics of comparing different technologies by looking at a case study.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Case study – forecasting demand for a logistics company</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p8">Let's imagine that we need to choose a time series forecasting framework for our project. Our team works primarily in Python and has to provide a tool that will provide forecasts for time series data. The main goal of this system is to forecast demand on a set of given products that are shipped by the company. The team has discovered that there are many different forecasting frameworks.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p8">To choose between these products, the team has created the following comparison criteria:</p>

<p class="p6">If you wish, you can use weighted averages to summarize each framework's score into a single number. However, remember that simplifying complex decisions into one number can lead to errors if this is done incorrectly.</p>
<p class="p6">These research results show that Prophet comes up as a better choice according to the initial requirements. However, the results do not mean that Prophet is the best choice for every application. Technology choices should be biased and opinionated since no technology can be the best fit for every project. For example, the ranking could be entirely different if the team took the desired average metric value into consideration. In this setting, other frameworks could have won because they provided more accurate models.</p>

<p class="p2">In this chapter, we have seen how we can choose a technology based on its requirements rather than the hype surrounding it. We also explored how to structure requirements and derive the main elements of a technology stack from software architecture. Finally, we discussed the difference between core and project-specific technology stacks and examined an analytical approach to comparing different technologies.</p>
<p class="p2">The next chapter will conclude this book; congratulations on finishing it!</p>

    for data science work with Python. Although they are not big data libraries per

    and others. But one of the oldest, most flexible, and most used is Matplotlib.
    But before going through the details of creating a graph with Matplotlib, let's

- en: Every analysis, whether on small or large datasets, involves a descriptive statistics
    step, where the data is summarized and described by statistics such as mean, median,
    percentages, and correlation. This step is commonly the first step in the analysis
    workflow, allowing a preliminary understanding of the data and its general patterns
    and behaviors, providing grounds for the analyst to formulate hypotheses, and
    directing the next steps in the analysis. Graphs are powerful tools to aid in
    this step, enabling the analyst to visualize the data, create new views and concepts,
    and communicate them to a larger audience.

    say that you are writing an analysis report that becomes extensive. Now, we need
    to create a summary of that extensive analysis. To make the analysis' points clear,
    a graph can be used to represent the data. This graph should be able to support
    the summary without the entire extensive analysis. To enable the graph to give
    more information and be able to stand out on its own in the summary, we have to
    add more information to it, such as a title and labels.

    color palettes and styles to make visualizations consistent and more informative.

    chart**. A line graph displays data as a series of interconnected points on two
    axes (*x* and *y*), usually **Cartesian**, ordered commonly by the *x*-axis. Line
    charts are useful for demonstrating trends in data, such as in **time series**,
    for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the data as points in Cartesian coordinates. Usually, two variables are demonstrated
    in this graph, although more information can be conveyed if the data is color-coded
    or size-coded by category, for example. Scatter plots are useful for showing the
    relationship and possible correlation between variables.

    the two previous examples, histograms show only one variable, usually on the *x*-axis,
    while the *y*-axis shows the frequency of occurrence of the data. The process
    of creating a histogram is a bit more involved than the line graph and the scatter
    plot, so we will explain them in a bit more detail.'

    distribution and outliers.'

    variables: understanding whether two variables show related behaviors. A scatter
    plot is the tool commonly used to visualize this. Histograms are useful for visualizing
    data point numbers in a bin or a range, such as the number of cars whose efficiency

    we created directly with Matplotlib as an argument. As we saw in the previous
    chapter, this is not required, but it will allow you to configure the plot outside
    pandas and change its configurations later. This same behavior can be applied
    to the other kinds of graphs. Let's now work with scatter plots.

    used because they allow the distribution of points to be seen. Creating a scatter
    plot with Matplotlib is similar to creating a line plot, but instead of using
    the `plot` method, we use the `scatter` method.

    only try to visualize the distribution of one variable, instead of two or more.
    Histograms have the goal of visualizing the probability distribution of one variable,
    or in other words, counting the number of occurrences of certain values divided
    into fixed intervals, or bins.

    and the analysis goal than any fixed, general rule. The larger the number of bins,
    the smaller (narrower) the size of each bin, and vice versa. When data has a lot
    of noise or variation, for example, a small number of bins (with a large bin)
    will show the general outline of the data, reducing the impact of the noise in
    a first analysis. A larger number of bins is more useful when the data has a higher

    information to it, for other analysis or for other users be able to grasp the
    graph content and understand what's being represented. We will now combine all
    of what we've learned in this chapter to create a complete graph, including a
    title, labels, and legends, and adjust the plot size.

- en: As an analyst, we want to understand whether the average miles per year increased
    or not, and we want to group by number of cylinders. For example, what is the
    behavior, in fuel consumption, of a car with three cylinders, over time? Is it
    higher or lower than a car with four cylinders?

    than cars with eight cylinders. We can also infer that all cars increased fuel
    efficiency during the studied period, with a decrease of four cylinders between
    1980 and 1982.

- en: In this chapter, we have seen the importance of creating meaningful and interesting
    visualizations when analyzing data. A good data visualization can immensely help
    the analyst's job, representing data in a way that can reach larger audiences
    and explain concepts that could be hard to translate into words or to represent
    with tables.

- en: A graph, to be effective as a data visualization tool, must show the data, avoid
    distortions, make understanding large datasets easy, and have a clear purpose,
    such as description or exploration. The main goal of a graph is to communicate
    data, so the analyst must keep that in mind when creating a graph. A useful graph
    is more desirable than a beautiful one.

    the scatter plot, the histogram, and the boxplot. Each graph has its purpose and
    application, depending on the data and the goal. We have also shown how to create
    graphs directly from Matplotlib, from pandas, or a combination of both, with Matplotlib''s
    APIs: Pyplot, the interactive API, and the object-oriented API. We finished this
    chapter with an explanation of the options for changing the appearance of a graph,
    from line styles to markers and colors, and how to save a graph to a hard copy
    format for printing or sharing.'

    of those tools, we will return to the analysis process, which will include graphs
    in diverse forms.

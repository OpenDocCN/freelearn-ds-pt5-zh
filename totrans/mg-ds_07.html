<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to conduct an efficient data science interview. We will explore how a hiring process can be tied to real working experience so that the candidates you seek will clearly understand what kind of job they will need to do. The advice in this chapter will help you to get rid of unnecessary interviewing rituals and make the hiring process more efficient.</p>
<p>How long has it been since you went through a technical interview? Was it a pleasant experience? And if you got through it, can you judge the relevance of your interview questions to your day-to-day work? I bet that the experience was awful. The common complaints are that all interviews are stressful, and the questions are not relevant. Technical interviews are deeply flawed. We imagine that we are using a rational way of thought to pass candidates through a sieve, selecting only the stellar experts who will do the job. In fact, interviews are biased. There is almost no correlation between success in an interview and success at the actual job. I would not be surprised if random candidate selection showed better results than the hiring processes of many companies.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common flaws of technical interviews</li>
<li>Introducing values and ethics into the interview</li>
<li>Designing good interviews</li>
</ul>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Common flaws of technical interviews</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you have a software engineering background, how often have interviewers asked you to reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard, or to find a maximum subarray sum? If you come from a data science background, how many central limit theorem proofs did you lay out on a piece of paper or a whiteboard? If you are a team leader, have you asked such questions yourself? I am not implying that those questions are bad, but quite the opposite. Knowledge of core computer science algorithms and the ability to derive proofs may be important for some jobs. But for what purpose do we ask those questions? What do we want to know about the person on the other side of the table? For most companies, the ability to give answers to those questions is not relevant at all. What is the reason for asking them? Well, because stereotypical programmers must know algorithms, and data scientists must know their mathematics and statistics; this way of thinking is logical and straightforward. When we think in this way, we imagine a general collective image of a rockstar programmer and a data science wizard. Reversing binary trees may be relevant for some projects in some company, but why is it relevant for yours?</p>
<p>I ask you to be open-minded, critical, and honest with yourself while reading this chapter. This text will not give you secret knowledge that will improve your interviews. It will give you tools. If you invest in them, you'll get back more straightforward, simple, and enjoyable interviews that will find the right people for the right job.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Most companies are looking for rockstar developers, stellar data scientists, and consist purely of the best people in the entire world. Let's look at a data scientist job description from a real job board.</p>
<p>The primary focus for a candidate will be on applying different techniques (data mining/statistical analysis/build prediction systems/recommendation systems) using large company datasets. Apply machine learning models and test the effectiveness of different actions. The candidate must have strong technical expertise and be able to use a wide set of tools for data mining/data analysis methods. The candidate must be able to build and implement mathematical models, algorithms, and simulations. We seek candidates with the following skillset:</p>

<li>Work in an environment that adapts quickly to creative change using agile principles.</li>
<li>Actively works with different development groups inside of organization.</li>
<li>Be ready to adapt a new tool/library/technology/platform.</li>
<li>Excellent understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms, such as <strong>k-nearest neighbors</strong> (<strong>kNNs</strong>), Naive Bayes, <strong>support vector machines</strong> (<strong>SVM</strong>), decision tree, clustering, artificial neural networks.</li>
<li>Strong understanding of math statistics (such as distributions, statistical testing, regression, and so on).</li>
<li>Experience creating and using advanced machine learning algorithms and statistical methods such as regression, simulation, scenario analysis, modeling, clustering, decision trees, neural networks, and so on.</li>

<li>Experience using statistical computer languages (R, Python, and so on) to manipulate and draw insights from large data sets.</li>
<li>Knowledge and experience using SQL language.</li>
<li>Experience using Azure/AWS services.</li>
<li>Experience with C++/C# as a plus.</li>
<li>Based on this description, the candidate must know 4 to 5 programming languages to a level that allows them to start a POC and finish with a production-ready system. More so, machine learning, deep learning, ETL, and business analysis skills are also a must. The candidate should be able to learn any new technology not present in the list. And he/she should be self-driven and independent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think about it, this is an ideal candidate. A one-man army, a unicorn. Do such people exist? Yes, but they are extremely rare. Does every company need people like this to complete their projects and achieve their goals? I will answer with a bold no. Instead of seeking the best fit for their goals, they seek the best fit for all possible goals. Being general and all-encompassing, this job search will be long, tiresome, and stressful. After reading this long list of requirements, the candidate won't be able to figure out what their job will be like. All descriptions are vague and hard to understand. This description does not give a hint about what this job will be like. The job description should give a clear listing of the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The future responsibilities of the candidate</li>
<li>Requirements for handling these responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When the job description is vague and convoluted, testing all required skills will surely require several interview sessions, which will make the process even more tiring. Adequate assessment of multiple candidates based on this list is close to impossible. After a long search, the company will just hire someone randomly. After this, the troubles won't end. The greatest problem of this job description is a lack of direction. The employer is not sure about the candidate's functions and responsibilities. This problem is deeper than it seems to be; the job description is actually only a symptom, not the illness itself. For the new employee, the obscurity and vagueness will not end on the first day on the new job. If the employer did not fully figure out what the new employee should do, the workflow itself will become an undetermined mess. Most of the interviews and hiring processes are a rationalization of a suboptimal, stressful, and biased candidate selection process. The good thing is that we can fix these problems. The only things you will need are honesty, a clear definition of your goals, and a bit of preparation. </p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Introducing values and ethics into the interview</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We often look at interviews from a one-sided perspective. We want to find a reliable team member who can do the job well. It is easy to forget that bad interviews can scare good candidates. More so, a constant flow of potential candidates make judgments about your company through the interviews. Bad interviews lead to bad publicity. The key to effective and smooth interviews is to think about the candidate experience.</p>
<p>If you have successfully defined honest requirements for the candidate, the next step is to think about the interview experience as a whole. To see a new teammate in the best light, the interview should look like a real working process, not like a graduate examination.</p>
<p>Consider how most technical interviews are conducted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You go through a resume filter. The best people have PhDs and at least 5 years of (questionable) experience in major tech companies.</li>
<li>You finish some kind of online test for your technical skills.</li>
<li>You submit your GitHub repositories and portfolio projects for review.</li>
<li>Then, you go through an online screening interview. You answer a series of technical questions related to a multitude of technologies and scientific areas that might be useful in your future work.</li>
<li>Next, you find yourself in a room with a whiteboard, where you answer a set of complicated and very specific problems on software development, software architecture, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, category theory, and other important topics that are used to select the best from the best.</li>
<li>Multiple people, each an expert in their field, will test you for different skills. It is likely that the interviewers will test you with tricky problems from their experience, each of which took them days to tackle.</li>
<li>Finally, a company executive will see if you are a good cultural fit and go along with the company values and goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only things left to add are a handful of DNA tests, IQ score filtering, a test on a lie detector, along with two checks for artistic and chess-playing abilities. </p>
<p>You may find it funny, but in certain Russian companies, software developers really do need to pass a lie detector test to get on board.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If you have clearly defined the position requirements, you will already see that most of those steps are unnecessary. More so, they can bias your interview process toward people who will be a bad fit for your job.</p>
<p>This process is nothing like your real working experience, where the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviews are intensely stressful, which significantly affects your performance.</li>
<li>You are being tested on topics unrelated to the tasks you will solve in the position.</li>
<li>Interview questions and home assignments are not related to tasks you will do at work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you could design an interview that is as close to real working experience as possible, all futile parts of the interview can go away, including prior work experience and education filters. </p>
<p>The interview process must respect the candidate's emotional condition and treat them as a human. It should be humanistic. The moment you start doing this, the potential candidate lists will grow and the interviews will be shorter and more effective. </p>
<p>Be open-minded and clear yourself of prejudices. Some of the most talented and successful software engineers, software architects, and data scientists I have worked with had unrelated job experiences or a lack of formal education. I am not stating that those things do not matter. They do, but they are not determining factors. Correlation does not mean causation. By rejecting candidates using unnecessary pre-screening filters, you miss opportunities to meet talented people who will stay with you for many years. Of course, some organizations need pre-screening filters. For example, you would not hire a surgeon without a diploma. In some fields, such as medicine, education gives essential experience that you can't get by yourself. But the situation changes drastically with fields such as software engineering and data science, where the knowledge and experience is accessible with a few keystrokes. </p>
<p>At last, remember to be human. Be nice to people you are talking with. Create a pleasant experience and you will get much better results. This can be hard if you are interviewing people for the whole day, so it is better to limit yourself to one or two interviews per day at the most.</p>
<p>You may think such interviews will take an unreasonable amount of your time and looking at every candidate is impossible. In fact, it is the opposite. The key to designing humanistic interviews is to shift the focus from your organization to the candidate, and we will explore ways to do this in the next section.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Designing good interviews</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>How can we make interviews more relevant and time-intensive? An ideal interview would be testing in a real working environment for a couple of months. While there are several companies that can afford to operate without interviews, using paid probation periods instead, this is a very costly hiring strategy that not every business can afford. A good interview should serve as a substitute for real working experience. It should not be a test of a person's skill, but a test for a person's ability to perform a specific job well. If an ideal test for a candidate is a probation period, then the worst kind is a whiteboard interview (unless you are interviewing a computer science lecturer). To design a great interview, bring it as close as possible to your working process and to the issues you solve on a daily basis.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Designing test assignments</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Of course, there might have been a couple of times when you or your colleagues in the same position needed to prove a theorem or implement a complex algorithm from scratch, but is it enough to include this problem in your interviewing process? If your team has encountered this problem only a few times, it deserves to be a supplementary question at most. Create most of the interview questions from the most frequent problems that your team solves daily. By no means search the web for interview questions. Your interview should be as specific as possible and generic questions will make it dull and unrelated to what you are searching for.</p>
<p>A frequent source of questions is the interviewer's own knowledge resources. You may have read many intricate and interesting books and blog posts. If the knowledge you gained from those materials, no matter how intellectually valuable, is unrelated to the candidate's job, please keep it out of the interview. Imagine a machine learning engineer interview where the candidate gets a question about mathematical details of the reparametrization trick in variational autoencoders when his job will be about delivering pretrained classifiers to production as scalable services.</p>
<p>The previous case might seem unrealistic to you, but it has happened to one of the software developers that I know. He was interviewing for a distributed system developer position. After some initial technical questions, the interviewer started asking about the subtleties of native code integration in Java applications:</p>
<p>Developer: <em>Do you integrate native code into your applications?</em><br/>
Interviewer: <em>No.</em><br/>
Developer: <em>That's good. Because I do not really know much about this topic.</em><br/>
Interviewer: <em>I'd like to ask about it anyway.</em></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Developer: <em>But I know little about native code integration. And, as you said, this is not relevant. Could we move on?</em><br/>
Interviewer asks the question.</p>
<p>This question was bad, no matter how you look at it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was irrelevant to the skill requirements in this position.</li>
<li>It was irrelevant to the company.</li>
<li>The interviewer already knew that the candidate could not provide an answer.</li>
<li>It increased the stress factor of the interview, possibly affecting the answers to the more relevant questions that followed.</li>
<li>It diminished the value of this company for the candidate.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, a good interview question should be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Related to the problems that the candidate will solve in his/her job</li>
<li>As hard or as simple as the candidate's daily working experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest problem of any interview question is its time span. We expect a typical interview problem to be solved in less than 10 minutes. The real working environment does not have such time constraints. To narrow the gap, you can create a test assignment. Ideally, this assignment should be implementable in 2 to 4 hours.</p>
<p>To create a test assignment, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a core task that is performed by similar roles (or directly by teammates with the same title) in your company.</li>
<li>Then, describe this task in one paragraph. You want your task description to be <strong>SMART</strong> (which stands for <strong>specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound</strong>).</li>
<li>Try to estimate how long it will take to implement. Since you are basing it on a real working experience, it could take days or weeks to finish the task. Only very dedicated candidates will be ready to take on an assignment with such a time span. You can shorten its length by decomposing it into several tasks and taking only the most important ones as a part of the assignment. You can transform all additional tasks into questions that you will ask while examining the test assignment results.</li>
<li>If you have the necessary skills, complete the assignment yourself, or ask for the help of your teammates. Note that if you cannot do the assignment yourself, you will need the help of your teammates during the interview.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">While doing the assignment, check everything about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it relevant?</li>
<li>Can you finish it within the expected time frame?</li>
<li>Does it test all the necessary skills for the position you are interviewing for?</li>
<li>Can you create additional questions about the assignment to structure the interview around it?</li>
</ul>
<p>It may take you a few iterations before you create a good test assignment. When you are done, you will need to decide where the candidates will implement the assignment. Depending on your requirements, the candidate may implement it remotely or you may ask them to sit in your office. If the assignment takes a significant amount of time to implement and you can't strip it down further, consider paying candidates for their time. Remember: hiring candidates who are not fit for the job will cost you a lot more.</p>
<p>For example, we can create a test assignment for a junior data scientist. Imagine that our company provides predictive analytics services for remote education platforms. Those companies need to estimate the propensity of successfully finishing a course for each of their students. Each client collects different data about their students. Although the model building process is fairly standardized, custom data preprocessing and feature engineering are required to create classifiers with satisfiable quality for each client. Our company promises that each client will get a model with an F1 score of at least 0.85.</p>
<p>Junior data scientists follow a standard procedure to create and deploy a classification model. The process is well documented and explained. It comprises several stages, such as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a training dataset provided by a data engineering team from the company's data portal web app.</li>
<li>Create a web-based data analysis and modeling environment using the company's self-service portal.</li>
<li>Upload data into the environment and create a holdout test set with at least 10% of the dataset.</li>
<li>Perform <strong>exploratory data analysis</strong> (<strong>EDA</strong>) and create a baseline classifier using the <strong>gradient boosting</strong> <strong>algorithm</strong>. Use 10-fold cross-validation for measuring the baseline F1 score.</li>
<li>Create new features from customer data and tune model parameters to improve the F1 score.</li>
<li>If you can reach an F1 validation score of no less than 0.85, measure the test score.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Report the results to your manager by generating a link to your environment.</li>
<li>Create a REST API using the company's guidelines if the results are approved.</li>
<li>Report the results to your manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most essential skills we want to test for this position are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to work with frameworks and tools our company uses for building classifiers</li>
<li>Ability to build binary classifiers</li>
<li>Ability to perform EDA and feature engineering on datasets similar to those we face in our daily work</li>
<li>Ability to follow the process and report results</li>
<li>Understanding of the reasoning behind the company's classifier building process </li>
</ul>
<p>To create a test assignment for a junior data scientist, we may create a dataset similar to ones from our customers. The candidate's model could achieve the necessary F1 score if the candidate creates several useful features from the raw data. The ideal environment for the candidate would be our company's office, but the remote option is also acceptable. We have offered both options to each candidate.</p>
<p>Our junior data scientists solve similar tasks in 2 to 3 hours. They spend most of the time on <em>step 5</em>. We have decided to artificially simplify the task so it will be solvable in under 1.5 hours. Learning how to use all the company's internal tooling, including a self-service portal, generally takes up to 4 hours, so we have also decided to use widely known open source tools for the test assignment. Most of the candidates will be already familiar with this option, and all of our internal systems are compatible with open source alternatives, so this would be a viable simplification.</p>
<p>We have created the following test assignment description:</p>
<p>We give you a CSV file with customers data. We ask you to build a binary classifier for student's propensity to finish a course. The description of each column in the data file is below: [… the description is missing for breviry]. You can use the following steps to build your model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform EDA and create a baseline classifier using the gradient boosting algorithm. Use 10-fold cross-validation for measuring the baseline F1 score.</li>
<li>Create new features from customer data and tune model parameters to improve F1 score.</li>
<li>If you can reach F1 validation score no less than 0.85, measure the test score.</li>
<li>Report results to us.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The expected time frame for this task is 1.5 hours, but you may ask for extensions. Please use the following tools to create the solution: […].</p>
<p>We have also created several additional questions to check the candidate's understanding of our process:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does cross-validation work?</li>
<li>What are the alternatives to cross-validation?</li>
<li>Why did you use a <strong>gradient boosting machine</strong> (<strong>GBM</strong>) to solve this problem?</li>
<li>Could you explain the general idea behind GBM? What implementations of GBM have you used previously? Could you tell us about their features?</li>
<li>What is an F1 score?</li>
<li>How does an F1 score differ from an accuracy score? In what situations do you prefer to use accuracy? And when does F1 work better?</li>
<li>Why do we need a separate test set?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that a technical assessment is not the only thing you want to check in the interview. Tell the candidate about your workflow and what your team does. Try to figure out whether the things you do will interest them enough. Highly motivated candidates who will flawlessly integrate into your workflow are often the best option even if their technical skills are inferior to those of other candidates. </p>
<p>To conclude, I will leave a simple rule for creating interview questions: ask questions about activities that are relevant for the daily working experience of the position you are searching for. A question should be highly abstract, theoretical, or complex only if the candidate should be able to solve such problems alone, on a daily basis (if this is so, provide an explanation why). Make interviews realistic and relevant. Ask for what you are looking for, no more and no less.</p>

<p>Interviewing should be a highly personal experience for each company, so providing interview templates or question sets would defeat the purpose of this chapter. However, a general checklist about what competencies and daily problems are relevant for each role of a data science project may serve you as a good first step in creating a personal and purposeful interview process.</p>

<p>No matter what position you are interviewing for, you should always check for the following abilities of a candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information search</strong> <strong>or Google skills</strong>: This might seem funny, but the ability to search for information is an extremely valuable skill for any technical expert. You never know what kind of algorithms, frameworks, or bugs you will encounter during a project. The ability to quickly find existing solutions and reuse the experience of the global data science community can save you spectacular amounts of time. If the candidate struggles to answer a technical question but can look up the solution and understand it, consider marking this answer as at least partially correct.</li>
<li><strong>Communication skills</strong>: When emulating a real workflow, take notice of the candidate's communication ability. Take notice of how he understands the task definition, asks for additional clarifications, and reports status. It is a good idea to tell the candidate that you will also be testing this set of skills beforehand and to provide a minor set of instructions. For example, you can allow and encourage intermediate communication during a take-home assignment. Many take-homes are finished in an isolated environment that is nowhere near to how we really collaborate on projects. Encouraging communication will allow you to have a glance at a real working experience with the candidate, make it an integral part of the test task.</li>
<li><strong>Software engineering skills</strong>: Every data science project role except the project manager needs coding skills. The better software the candidate can build, the less work will be required to integrate their piece into the whole system.</li>
<li>If the candidate does not know something, it's OK. People get nervous, forget details, or lack relevant experience. Look at the interview as a two-sided process,<strong> </strong>where you are trying to work through the questions together with the candidate. Real work does not look like an examination, does it? Plus, in most cases, the person who is able to quickly work through the problem together with the team even if they don't know the solution will be valuable.</li>
<li>Do not be a victim of the <em>curse of knowledge</em>. The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that is often seen when a person with certain knowledge assumes that others have all the necessary background to understand them well, or at least overestimates this background. Do not expect the candidate to fully understand and easily solve the problem that your team solved a few days ago. Deep knowledge of specifics of the datasets you work with and subtleties of the problems that your team solves on a daily basis are simply inaccessible to the candidate. Be conscientious about the curse of knowledge and simplify your questions to match the candidate's background.</li>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Interviewing data scientists</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When interviewing data scientists, keeping your eye on the following qualities might help you to make a better choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of data scientist are you looking for? A research data scientist will be able to implement state-of-the-art models and push the boundaries of the discipline, but a machine learning engineer will be more proficient in quick application of existing best practices while maintaining good software design. Many companies need the second type of data scientist but are trying to hire the first one. Do not make this mistake and be honest about your needs as a company.</li>
<li>Ask about the overall workflow of building a model, and specifically about delivering the model into production. Pay attention to the offline and online testing strategies that the candidate chooses to evaluate the model. Many experts have a good understanding of the inner workings of the algorithms but lack a coherent end-to-end approach for testing and delivering a model.</li>
<li>Ask about common problems in the datasets you are working with. If your team constantly faces the problem of imbalanced data, be sure to check whether the candidate has an instinct for solving problems of this kind.</li>
<li>If you work in a specific business domain, do not forget to ask about domain expertise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget to look for the following qualities when searching for data engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start from the specific technologies the data engineer will work with. There is a multitude of different databases and data processing technologies, so you should have a good understanding of what technology stack you are looking for because nobody knows everything. A big data engineer<strong> </strong>will back you up on taming the big data zoo of technologies and writing complex Apache Spark jobs. A backend developer with extensive experience in relational databases and data integration will help you to process datasets from traditional data warehouses and will easily integrate your solution with other systems.</li>
<li>If the data engineering work at your company is related to distributed data processing systems (Apache Spark, for example), then do not forget to touch on this topic in the interview. Distributed systems suffer from the problem of leaky abstractions: when problems in code start to arise, the developer should have a good instinct about how the system works internally to solve the issue. This does not mean that every data engineer should be an expert in distributed algorithms and know everything about quorums, but they should be able to have enough knowledge to make reasonable choices when designing distributed data processing flows.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this chapter, we have looked at the importance of setting goals before starting the interview process. We have explained why asking complex theoretical questions without a clear purpose is harmful not only to the candidate but also to the interviewer's company. We have explored the flaws of modern interviews and gained tools for making them purposeful and meaningful. We have seen what separates a good job description from a bad one. Also, we have defined a framework for creating interview questions from real tasks that you and your teammates solve on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will develop guidelines for building data science teams.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The Future – Healthcare and Emerging Technologies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So far in this book, we've examined the exciting history of healthcare analytics and some of the ways it currently impacts our healthcare system. In this chapter, we provide a sense of the latest developments in the field and what will likely be coming to healthcare analytics in the not-so-distant future. We'll delve into healthcare and the internet, specifically the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) and social media applications, to see how they are playing roles in improving health. Next, we'll take a look at some of the new algorithms (collectively referred to as "deep learning") that are achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical prediction tasks. Finally, although this book has presented the state of healthcare analytics in a hopeful and optimistic fashion, there are still some considerable obstacles and barriers that must be overcome for healthcare analytics to disruptively impact our healthcare system for the better. We'll discuss those at the end of the book.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare analytics and the internet</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Physically, the <strong>internet</strong> is a specific computer network that connects millions of computing devices worldwide. Practically, it is an infrastructure that provides services to applications such as email, social networks, data storage, and communication (Kurose and Ross, 2013). The internet rose to prominence in the 1990s and affected virtually every industry in the global economy; healthcare is no exception. As we discussed in <a href="71c31b0a-fa9e-4b31-8b58-f563a815e338.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Healthcare Foundations</em>, clinical data is increasingly being stored electronically on computers, and third parties who perform analytics with this data often receive the data via the internet and use the cloud to store this data. Furthermore, the results of the analytics are often communicated back to the healthcare organization via an internet technology known as an <strong>application programming interface</strong> (<strong>API</strong>) by which the healthcare organization sends a request for specific information to a server and receives that information.</p>

<p>Aside from the typical data exchange cycle discussed throughout this book, which obviously relies heavily on the internet, there are some fringe methods through which the internet is affecting healthcare. Let's take a look at two of those methods here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet of Things</li>
<li>Social media</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare and the Internet of Things</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Although, traditionally, we think of the internet as a network for computers, in recent years, additional types of devices have joined the fray. The IoT is a network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and internet connectivity, enabling these devices to exchange data (Dimitrov, 2016). To date, much work has been done with the IoT in the healthcare space, and the implications of the IoT for healthcare are considerable. One emerging function of the IoT is to be able to remotely monitor patient health (Ma et al., 2017). A prototypical example is provided by a group of researchers at UCLA who developed a weight, activity, and blood pressure patient-monitoring system for CHF called <strong>WANDA</strong> (Suh et al., 2011). Increased weight due to fluid retention, decreased activity, and uncontrolled blood pressure are critical markers of CHF decompensation; WANDA uses weight scales and blood pressure monitors to communicate measurements about the patient to the patient's phone via Bluetooth. The phone then sends this data to a backend database in the cloud, along with activity and symptom information about the patient collected from a phone-based app. The data can then be used to perform logistic regression (similar to that we discussed in <a href="71c31b0a-fa9e-4b31-8b58-f563a815e338.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Healthcare Foundations</em> and <a href="d029d858-9c6e-4bf0-b793-87cdc4395e86.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Making Predictive Models in Healthcare</em>) to alert a physician in case the patient is at risk of CHF decompensation. All of this is done privately and securely. This is a prime example of how one of the deadliest and most morbid chronic diseases can be fought using the IoT.</p>
<p>Although the IoT-healthcare partnership has promise, major obstacles and barriers include effective interdevice communication (device companies often use their own proprietary languages), maintenance of patient privacy and security, and ease of use for the patient (Dimitrov, 2016). Certainly, the IoT space will be one to watch as we look toward the future.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare analytics and social media</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A different type of internet application for improving health is the use of social media applications, such as Facebook and Twitter, to monitor and forecast disease epidemics. An <strong>epidemic</strong> is a sudden and widespread occurrence of a particular disease in a community.</p>
<p>Social media is well adapted for tracking epidemics because they create senses of anonymity and freedom to express personal feelings and information (Charles-Smith et al., 2015). The analysis of language used on social media sites has shed light on various disease outbreaks including alcohol and drug abuse, congestive heart failure, and infectious diseases (Brathwaite et al., 2016). Here we take a look at how social media is being used to combat two prominent epidemics: influenza and suicide.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Influenza surveillance and forecasting</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>One recent study by Johns Hopkins University in Maryland sought to determine whether user "tweets" or messages on Twitter can be used to forecast or predict the rate of influenza in the following weeks (Paul et al., 2014). They used a basic linear autoregressive model, which is similar to logistic regression except that the features are the influenza rates of the previous weeks and the coefficients are determined by least squares regression. They compared models that used only the CDC's published weekly rates with models that also used a Twitter influenza surveillance system that analyzes tweets to determine whether they are about influenza infections. Their study found that incorporating Twitter data helps reduce errors in the predicted influenza rate by 15 - 30% up to 10 weeks into the future. Similarly, a review study analyzing the use of social media for monitoring disease found that joint information from social media sites and national health statistics predicted outbreaks before standard outbreak surveillance systems (Charles-Smith et al., 2015).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Predicting suicidality with machine learning</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and its incidence is rising, placing unprecedented emotional and financial burdens on its victims' families (Brathwaite et al., 2016). In the afore-cited study, by Brigham Young University, researchers recruited 135 participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (<a href="https://www.mturk.com/">www.mturk.com</a>) and asked them to complete three clinically validated questionnaires for assessing suicide risk. In addition, the researchers analyzed the tweets of each participant using a language analysis tool that extracts features from the text. The features largely measure the frequency of certain word categories including "family," "anger," and "sadness." They used Python and the scikit-learn library to then build models that classified each of these "training set" participants as suicidal or not suicidal. To test their model on previously unseen data, they used leave-one-out cross-validation, a procedure in which only one participant was used as test data, and this was repeated 135 times. Their decision tree model obtained an accuracy of 91.9% and had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Certainly, this is encouraging for identifying suicidal patients before they commit suicidal acts, although it remains to be seen how privacy would be preserved in such a suicide-monitoring system.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare and deep learning</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>No book on healthcare analytics would be complete without a discussion of deep learning. In recent years, unparalleled results have been achieved in the areas of speech recognition, face recognition, language understanding, and object identification using deep learning algorithms (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Almost in tandem have been the breakthroughs in healthcare; from cancer detection on pathology slides and radiology scans to predicting mortality and readmissions, time and time again, results are being seen that rival (and in some cases surpass) committees of expert physicians.</p>
<p>We have already discussed some aspects of deep learning briefly. In <a href="b15b2b73-d2bb-410f-ab55-5f0f1e91730e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to Healthcare Analytics,</em> we discussed a historical paper that is seen by many to have been a seminal event for deep learning as a field, in <a href="46c83498-cb6e-45b4-ac39-6875a8d32400.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Machine Learning Foundations,</em> we discussed deep neural networks as a medical decision-making framework, and in <a href="769ebf9f-6174-4a9b-b4e0-44d9ebafd6f1.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>,<a href="769ebf9f-6174-4a9b-b4e0-44d9ebafd6f1.xhtml" target="_blank"/> <em>Healthcare Predictive Models – A Review,</em> we discussed some studies that used deep learning algorithms to achieve their results. Let's now briefly discuss what deep learning is and what distinguishes it from traditional machine learning and neural networks. We will then discuss some promising studies that use the following subtypes of deep learning algorithms in reaching their conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep feed-forward networks</li>
<li><strong>Convolutional neural networks</strong> (<strong>CNN</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Recurrent neural networks</strong> (<strong>RNN</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have decided to keep discussion of the theory of deep learning out of this book since a brief, simplistic chapter on deep learning theory would not do the field justice. There are, however, some excellent courses on Coursera (<a href="http://www.coursera.org">www.coursera.org</a>) that explain what deep learning is mathematically in a very easy-to-follow manner.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What is deep learning, briefly?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Deep learning</strong> has been defined as an approach to artificial intelligence in which high-level understanding is obtained through the expression and combination of simpler, low-level representations (Goodfellow et al., 2016).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Today, the use of the term <em>deep learning</em> to describe a machine learning method or algorithm usually implies the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The algorithm is loosely modeled after the human neuron, using artificial neurons. In other words, the building block of a deep neural network is an artificial neuron that takes a <strong>sum of weighted input</strong> (similar to a regression model) and then applies a <strong>nonlinear transformation</strong> to that sum.</li>
<li>Unlike regression, a deep neural network usually has many layers of neurons, with an <strong>input layer</strong> at the beginning of the model, an <strong>output layer</strong> at the end of the model, and at least one <strong>hidden</strong> <strong>layer</strong> in between the input and output layers. The output of one layer is then fed into the next layer until the output layer is reached.</li>
<li>To train the weights of the model to predict the output correctly, since there are so many, we must use many, many examples (billions in some cases). A high number of training examples is implied in deep learning. The deeper and more complex the network, the more training examples we need.</li>
<li>Deep learning uses the <strong>backpropagation</strong> algorithm to train the weights properly, and the backpropagation algorithm relies on calculus and linear algebra.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Deep learning in healthcare</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There have been many studies that have applied this new class of algorithms to healthcare problems. Let's now take a tour.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Deep feed-forward networks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In <a href="769ebf9f-6174-4a9b-b4e0-44d9ebafd6f1.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Healthcare Predictive Models – A Review</em>, we discussed a study by Duke University that predicted hospital readmissions using a variety of algorithms (Futoma et al., 2015). In the second part of the study, they used a deep feed-forward network (similar to the one schematically depicted previously) that had three hidden layers, each consisting of 200-750 neurons depending on the specific condition. As their nonlinear activation function, they used the <kbd>sigmoid</kbd> function for almost all of the layers except for the output layer, where they used the <kbd>softmax</kbd> function (a common practice in deep learning). They made a model for each of the five CMS incentivized conditions (pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, and total hip/knee arthroplasty) and pretrained each network with all of the observations pertaining to each disease (recall that there were approximately 3,000,000 observations in total).</p>

<p>They used a number of other tricks to achieve maximal performance, including ridge regression penalization, dropout, and early stopping (see Goodfellow et al., 2016, for an explanation of these techniques). They achieved better results than the best non-deep learning algorithm for all of the five conditions (although the improvement was significant for only three of the five diseases). Their reported AUC is better than the previously reported AUC for the LACE and HOSPITAL readmission scores. Therefore, this is an example that demonstrates the promise of deep learning for solving complex prediction problems in healthcare, although it also highlights the difficulty and complexity with which such models are trained.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Convolutional neural networks for images</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the previous section, it was stated that neural networks employ weighted sums followed by nonlinear transformations to determine what values are used in the next layer. While this is generally true for feed-forward networks, this does not have to be true for all networks; different mathematical functions can be used apart from weighted sums to determine the next layer's input. In a different type of neural network, called a CNN, a convolution operation is used to determine the next layer's input. Typically, convolution operations are immediately followed by <strong>pooling</strong> operations (such as <strong>max pooling</strong>, in which the largest value is chosen from a discrete area to pass on to the next layer).</p>
<p>Networks that employ these types of operations are well-suited to data that is regularly sampled, such as images or time series data. Therefore, convolutional neural networks are popular in healthcare for processing data taken from pathology slides, radiology scans, and other images, and for detecting various diseases from them.</p>
<p><strong>Pathology</strong> is a branch of medicine concerned with the evaluation of cross-sectional microscopic slides taken from human tissue samples. Examination of the slides is often done to classify tissue as cancerous or non cancerous. A pathologist sometimes has to examine very large images to look for any signs of cancerous tissue, which is very time-consuming and susceptible to errors. A recent study by Google, Inc. sought to determine whether a convolutional neural network could do a better job than pathologists at detecting breast cancer in lymph node tissue (Liu et al., 2017). For the study, slides as large as 100,000 x 100,000 pixels were used. The model was able to achieve an AUC between 0.965 and 0.986, while the pathologists achieved an AUC of 0.966. More significantly, the model produced its classification virtually instantaneously, while the human pathologist took 30 hours! This is an example of how artificial intelligence can be combined with human breadth and depth of knowledge to enhance cancer detection from pathology images. Similar types of studies can be performed on radiology scans as well.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Recurrent neural networks for sequences</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Another type of specialized deep neural network is called a <strong>recurrent neural network</strong>, which is particularly suited to sequential data. A variant of recurrent neural networks is referred to as <strong>long short-term memory networks</strong> (<strong>LSTMs</strong> for short) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTM networks contain <strong>LSTM cells</strong>, which are cells that receive an input vector and produce an output vector. The LSTM cell is intricate and consists of various "gates" that regulate the output of the cell known as <strong>input gates</strong>, <strong>output gates</strong>, and <strong>forget gates</strong>. The gates, in turn, are partially controlled by the input at the previous time step. LSTMs have been the networks behind many of the successful results achieved in handwriting recognition, speech recognition, language translation, and image captioning (Goodfellow et al., 2016).</p>
<p>A recent study, again by Google, Inc., used deep learning architectures, including an LSTM architecture, to predict in-hospital mortality, unplanned readmission, prolonged length of stay, and final discharge diagnoses (Rajkomar et al., 2018). They achieved state-of-the-art results.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Obstacles, ethical issues, and limitations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Given our touting of recent analytic and machine learning results throughout this book, why haven't doctors been replaced by computers yet? The truth is that there are many <strong>obstacles</strong> that stand in the way of implementing analytics in healthcare. <strong>Ethical issues</strong> introduced by this technology are also fiercely debated and must be considered. Finally, while obstacles imply a possibility of being overcome, there are also <strong>limitations</strong> to this technology, or aspects that likely will not be solved anytime soon. Let's discuss all three of these things in this section.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Obstacles</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>What are some of the current obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve widespread use of analytics for improving healthcare?</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare has traditionally been slow to adopt emerging technologies, and this is a challenge that must be overcome. Healthcare has been described as a conservative field, one that is slow to embrace change. For example, there was some initial resistance to the idea of using electronic blood pressure cuffs in hospitals. Also facing skepticism and resistance was the advancement of electronic medical records, because of concerns that it takes away from the patient-physician interaction and increases the time required to write notes. Analytics and machine learning is certainly no exception; it is simply another new, unfamiliar technology, and while industries such as automotive and manufacturing embraced it with little issue, healthcare will likely be a different story.</li>
<li>Perhaps an important underlying reason why doctors resist analytics and machine learning is the fear that computers are trying to "take over" or "replace" physicians. Certainly, we are a long way off from having that conversation, in terms of money, technology, and time. The machine learning studies we have discussed in this book are trained in very specific tasks, and of course, they rely on human intuition and judgment when being trained and interpreted. More likely, successful health analytics and machine learning will be achieved by utilizing a team approach, in which human strengths (such as generalizability and breadth of knowledge) are combined with computing strengths (speed and computational precision) to yield the best possible result. Still, the concern that physicians have about being replaced by computers is a real possibility, however distant, and we must find ways for physicians and artificial intelligence to work together rather than against one another.</li>
<li>Another reason for skepticism toward analytics is the "hope versus hype" debate. Buzzphrases such as "big data" and "deep learning" sometimes carry negative connotations because of the hype surrounding them. Some people think that belief in these fields is overinflated. Specifically, skeptics of analytics and machine learning argue that most big data applications, while they "sound cool," rarely save lives or money. Certainly, these concerns are valid; contributing positively to society is something that all machine learning studies should strive for, rather than simply demonstrating that something can be done.</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Ethical issues</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Ethics has always been a part of considering new technologies, including computer science, and must not be ignored here. What are some of the ethical issues introduced by healthcare analytics?</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, in my opinion, is the inability to place a value or a number on human feelings and painlessness. Many machine learning models are trained using a cost function. What should the cost function be? Should it be based on decreasing costs, increasing quality and outcomes, or decreasing pain and heartbreak? Who determines the ratio with which these seemingly opposing goals should be pursued?</li>
<li>Another ethical issue introduced by artificial intelligence is the question of responsibility. If a machine learning model makes an errant prediction, who is to be held responsible? Should it be the physician who oversaw the patient? Or should it be the team of data scientists that made the model?</li>
<li>A third issue lies in the realm of patient privacy. We discussed HIPAA laws in <a href="71c31b0a-fa9e-4b31-8b58-f563a815e338.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Healthcare Foundations</em>. Is it right to use patient data to train models? Should it require consent or not? Which data points should be allowed to be used?</li>
<li>Finally, there is the problem of bias. There is a concern that predicting outcomes on patients may depend on things such as race, gender, and age. This may lead to patient discrimination.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Limitations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Limitations are those aspects of healthcare analytics that may never be overcome. What are some limitations of healthcare analytics?</p>
<ul>
<li>Robots and computers are not human, and they currently cannot replace a human's ability to offer comfort and empathy in the face of pain, illness, or death.</li>
<li>Technologies such as neural networks, while they may offer accurate predictions, suffer from the black box problem—they cannot explain their reasoning or logic to the patient. Therefore, a patient may not trust a neural network completely the way a patient trusts a good physician.</li>
<li>While the field of machine learning is constantly changing, time series and natural language processing are particularly important in the field of healthcare, and these areas are weaknesses of machine learning algorithms as opposed to structured clinical data. It may be some time before an algorithm can be written that reads text, makes generalizations, and asks relevant questions like humans do.</li>

<p>In this book, we focused on healthcare analytics with the triple aim of healthcare: reducing cost, improving outcomes, and increasing care quality. Now that you have read the book, you can hopefully see more clearly how healthcare analytics can accomplish that. It can reduce healthcare costs by diagnosing problems correctly (with the help of inexpensive machine learning algorithms) and preventing unnecessary tests. It can improve healthcare outcomes by diagnosing problems sooner rather than later, allowing for corrective action to take place. Finally, it can increase quality by determining which hospitals are providing proper and timely care, and rewarding those hospitals for doing so.</p>
<p>With the aim of improving healthcare throughout the world, this book has introduced to you several friends that will help you to achieve that task:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Python language, including the base language and external libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn</li>
<li>The SQL language</li>
<li>Machine learning algorithms</li>
<li>Healthcare domain knowledge</li>
<li>Some math</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading about what has become a central goal and mission in my life. Now let's improve healthcare, one model at a time.</p>

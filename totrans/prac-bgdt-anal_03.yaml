- en: There are several platforms today that are used for large-scale data analytics.
    At a broad level, these are divided into platforms that are used primarily for
    data mining, such as analysis of large datasets using NoSQL platforms, and those
    that are used for data science—that is, machine learning and predictive analytics.
    Oftentimes, the solution may have both the characteristics—a robust underlying
    platform for storing and managing data, and solutions that have been built on
    top of them that provide additional capabilities in data science.

- en: If you're installing Hadoop on a local machine, it is recommended that your
    system should have at least 4-8 GB of RAM (memory) and sufficient free disk space
    of at least 50 GB. Ideally, 8 GB or more memory will suffice for most applications.
    Below this, the performance will be lower but not prevent the user from carrying
    out the exercises. Please note that these numbers are estimates that are applicable
    for the exercises outlined in this book. A production environment will naturally
    have much higher requirements, which will be discussed at a later stage.

- en: Installing analytics software, especially platforms such as Hadoop, can be quite
    challenging in terms of technical complexity and it is highly common for users
    to encounter errors that would have to be painstakingly resolved. Users spend
    more time attempting to resolve errors and fixing installation issues than they
    ideally should. This sort of additional overhead can easily be alleviated by using
    **virtual machines** (**VMs**), or more recently, containers such as Docker. For
    simpler platforms such as R and Python, we'll be using open source versions that
    come preinstalled with various libraries.

    Cloud-based services. Cloud services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure
    from Microsoft provide an extremely agile and versatile environment to provision
    servers on demand at a cost of a few cents to a few dollars per hour of usage.
    While cloud installation is beyond the scope of this book, it is very simple to
    create a free AWS Account and use the same to install the different pieces of
    analytics software discussed in this book. Note that if you are using AWS/Azure
    or any of the other cloud services, you'll need to use the Docker version of Cloudera
    Hadoop distribution.

    machine-learning-related packages that are installed natively as part of the platform.
    This alleviates the need for the practitioner to manually download and install
    packages. In that sense, it is conceptually similar in spirit to Microsoft R Open.
    Just as Microsoft R enhances the base open source R offering with additional functionality,
    Anaconda improves upon the offerings of base open source Python to provide new

- en: This chapter introduced some of the key tools used for data science. In particular,
    it demonstrated how to download and install the virtual machine for the Cloudera
    Distribution of Hadoop (CDH), Spark, R, RStudio, and Python. Although the user
    can download the source code of Hadoop and install it on, say, a Unix system,
    it is usually fraught with issues and requires a fair amount of debugging. Using
    a VM instead allows the user to begin using and learning Hadoop with minimal effort
    as it is a complete preconfigured environment.

    learning and in general, analytics. They are available for all popular operating
    systems. Although they can be installed in the VM, the user is encouraged to try
    and install them on their local machines (laptop/workstation) if feasible as it
    will have relatively higher performance.

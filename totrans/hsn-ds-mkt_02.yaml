    may be familiar already, the importance and application of data science in the
    marketing industry have been rising significantly over the past few years. Yet,
    marketing data science is a relatively new field and the amount of resources available
    for education and references lags behind the momentum. However, the amount of
    data gathered and available to the process has been growing exponentially each
    year, which opens up even more opportunities to learn and bring insight from the
    data.

    we can easily find examples of the usage of data science to marketing efforts.
    Companies are starting to use data science to better understand customer behaviors
    and identify different customer segments based on their activity patterns. Many
    organizations also use machine learning to predict future customer behaviors,
    such as what items are they likely to purchase, which websites are they likely
    to visit, and who are likely to churn. With endless use cases of data science
    for marketing, companies of all sizes can benefit from using data science and
    machine learning for their marketing efforts. After this brief introductory chapter,
    we will learn about how to apply data science and machine learning for individual
    marketing tasks.

    than ever before, the importance and effectiveness of digital marketing have been
    rising with time. Lots of marketing activities are now happening on digital channels,
    such as search engines, social network, email, and websites. For example, Google
    Ads helps your brand to get more exposure to potential customers through its search
    engine, Gmail, or YouTube. You can easily customize your target audience, to whom
    you want your advertisements to be shown. Facebook and Instagram are two of the
    well-known social networks, where you can post your advertisements to reach your
    target customers. In the era of the internet, these marketing channels have become

    the performances of marketing efforts. Not only does it help you to understand
    how much sales or exposure you gain from marketing, but it can also help you gain
    deeper insights into more individual level patterns and trends. In e-commerce
    businesses, you can analyze and visualize the different types and segments of
    customers and which type of customers drives the revenue for your business the
    most with marketing analytics. In media businesses, with marketing analytics,
    you can analyze which content attracts the users the most and what the trends
    in keyword searches are. Marketing analytics also helps you to understand the
    cost-effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. By looking into the **return on
    investment** (**ROI**), you can further optimize your future marketing campaigns.
    As the adoption and usage of marketing analytics rise, it is not difficult to
    find various software products for marketing analytics.'

    science and machine learning in marketing, another trend in marketing is individual-level
    target marketing. Various organizations of different sizes utilize machine learning
    algorithms to learn from the user history data and apply different and specialized
    marketing strategies to smaller and more specific subgroups of their user base,
    which results in lower cost per acquisition and higher return on investment. In
    retail businesses, many companies implement artificial intelligence and machine
    learning to predict which customers are more likely to purchase and which items
    they are going to buy from their stores. Using these predictions, they customize
    the marketing messages to each of their customers. Many of media businesses also
    utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive higher engagement
    from individual users to grow their user base. As these customized and target
    marketing result in higher ROI, there are many SaaS companies, such as Sailthru
    and Oracle, that provide platforms for personalized marketing. Sailthru recently
    published a *Retail Personalization Index* report, which analyzes how various
    retail companies use personalized marketing in different marketing channels. In
    this report, we can find that retail companies, such as Sephora, JustFab, and
    Walmart, use personalized marketing heavily in their websites, emails, and other
    marketing channels. This report can be found at this link: [https://www.sailthru.com/personalization-index/sailthru100/](https://www.sailthru.com/personalization-index/sailthru100/).'

    predict who will make purchases in the next few days, then we will use supervised
    learning algorithms. Here, the prediction target or outcome is whether this person
    made a purchase within the given time window or not. Based on the historical purchase
    data, we will need to build features, which describe each data point, such as
    a user''s age, address, last purchase date, and then supervised learning algorithms
    will learn from this data how to map these features to the prediction target or
    outcome. We will be exploring how to use such algorithms in marketing in [Chapter

    learning algorithms to cluster your customer base into different subgroups or

    learning in marketing is when there are multiple marketing strategies you''d like
    to test and choose the one that works the best. In this case, you can run a reinforcement
    learning algorithm, where it randomly picks one strategy at a time and gets rewarded
    when a positive outcome occurs. After multiple iterations of trials and errors,

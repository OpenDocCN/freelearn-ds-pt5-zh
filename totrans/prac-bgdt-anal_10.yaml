    used for big data, for data science, and for machine learning. We have learned
    about how companies are implementing their big data corporate strategies. We have
    also developed a handful of real-world applications along the way.

    initiatives at corporations. The field is continually evolving, with the introduction
    of newer technologies, newer open source tools, and new concepts in data mining.
    Due to this, organizations of all sizes share common challenges.

    aspects of data science. Indeed, it has become an indispensable and integral aspect

    data science, the shared challenges, and what you can do to make your initiative
    successful. Further, we’ll look at major successes in data science as well as
    examples where data science failed to live up to its promise. We’ll also provide
    a set of links to resources where you can go to learn more about the relevant
    topics.

    is no definitive framework, other than perhaps Hadoop, which has been the de facto
    framework that most companies have adopted. Senior level management are often

    This is due to the fact that the field encompasses elements of both analytics
    as well as technology. The former, analytics, is usually owned by the business-facing
    divisions of the organization, whereas technology is owned by IT departments.
    However, in data science, both elements are required. Individuals who are data
    *specialists*, that is, those who understand the domain very well and have experience
    with the data used in the domain, can be great business subject matter experts.
    They may also be able to comprehensively identify the ideal use cases and how
    the data can be best utilized. However, without having strong technical acumen,
    it would be difficult to identify the right tools to realize the vision.

    However, rather than adopting a rigid directional approach, a collaborative, iterative,
    and agile process is often the best solution. There will be decisions, and changes
    to decisions based on new requirements and discoveries during the course of assessing
    big data needs, and prior evaluations may need to be modified in order to meet
    modified objectives.

- en: Big data often involves the gathering of large volumes of data that may contain
    users' personal information. Companies such as Facebook and Google have flourished
    on analyzing individual information to target ads and perform other types of marketing.
    This evidently poses an ethical dilemma. To what extent should personal data be
    collected? And how much is *too much?* There are, of course, no correct answers
    to these questions. The rise of hacking in which information from hundreds of
    millions of user accounts has been compromised is so commonplace today that we
    have almost become complacent about the consequences.

    account on Yahoo!, had suffered a data breach. **Equifax**, one of the largest
    credit reporting companies in the US suffered a data breach that exposed the personal
    details of more than 140 million consumers. There were scores of other similar
    incidents, and in all of them, the common denominator was that all the companies
    collected some level of users' personal information, whether directly or via third
    parties.

    of suitable IT security in order to ensure that the data does not get compromised.
    The repercussions are not limited to only the loss of data, but collateral damage
    due to impact on reputation and goodwill, apart from the primary fact that real
    people are involved whose data has been compromised.

    any personal information, becomes critically important. Cloud providers, such
    as AWS and Azure, have gained traction partly due to the fact that they have very
    stringent standards of security as well as certifications that allow organizations
    to offload the responsibility to a trusted and formidable entity.

    an excellent step toward securing the personal data of its citizens. In a nutshell,
    the GDPR regulates the use of any personal data. In this context, the term any
    is extremely broad, including even the very name of an individual. Violators of
    the rule will be fined up to 20 million euro, or 4 percent of the global turnover
    of the defaulting organization.

    those that relate to individual data, it may also stir a debate and perhaps innovations

    browsing and app data.

    are drawn to the region. Startups have sprung up, many of them commanding tens
    of millions of dollars in VC investment. However, entrepreneurs should heed statistical
    warnings given the high failure percentage of startup businesses. It is one thing
    to have a great idea, with a potential high commercial value. Turning the idea
    into a commercial success requires a different kind of skill and business acumen.

    still need to use proper judgment to decide on our ideal use cases. This is not
    trivial. Large companies find initiatives just as challenging (although at a higher
    scale) as seasoned big data professionals.

    and gain foresight with the help of sophisticated algorithms and code. However,
    it is still incumbent upon the user to evaluate the results and make decisions
    not solely based on the predicted output. Users should apply common sense and
    experience in making such assessments. If the GPS instructs the driver to go on
    a certain road on a snowy winter night and the driver knows that the road won't
    have been cleared by the snowplow, it wouldn’t be prudent to follow the GPS instructions
    blindly.

    and machine during the 2016 election. Extensive models that estimated, using very
    sophisticated algorithms, the high probability of Clinton winning the elections
    were all proven wrong. Eminent data scientists and leading statistical organizations
    estimated that there was an 80-90 percent chance of a Clinton presidency. What
    we all missed was the human element of making decisions. We relied too intently
    on model sophistication instead of trying to understand how people really felt
    and whether their assertions on, say, an informal survey would be aligned with
    their final choice of candidate and true feelings about them.

    on investment. In particular, it is hard to accurately measure the success of
    projects that involve making long-term predictions. As noted in an earlier chapter,
    for departments to advance the cause of data science, it is essential for them
    to show early successes. In general, projects that a) are short term; b) have
    a measurable outcome; and c) can benefit and will be used a wide range of users
    are some of the key factors that help to establish credibility and ensure success
    of data science related projects.

    a deep learning algorithm in late 2016 that could assess the flow of blood to
    the heart in a fraction of the time compared to conventional scanners. It met
    all the key criteria of success. The benefits were obvious almost immediately,
    the algorithm provided a directly measurable outcome since you could compare the
    results with those from scanners and it was useful to a broad range of users,
    namely, patients. Further, the topic was very intuitive.

    The benefits of such a product are also quite obvious. Being able to get results

    the algorithm. It was a monumental achievement.

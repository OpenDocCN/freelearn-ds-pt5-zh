<p class="p1">In this chapter, we will conclude the <em>Managing Data Science Projects</em> section by looking at how we can help products grow and improve reusability. This chapter focuses on teams who work to deliver custom solutions for customers. You will find the content in this chapter helpful if your team helps internal business stakeholders at the company or external customers who want to buy expertise, services, and software solutions. The benefits of product thinking and reusability are underappreciated when it comes to the consultation stage, whereas they become more obvious if your team is developing a product that is focused on a market niche.</p>
<p class="p1">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3">Thinking of projects as products</li>
<li class="li3">Determining the stage of your project</li>
<li class="li3">Improving reusability</li>
<li class="li3">Seeking and building products</li>
</ul>

<p class="p5">To benefit from the ideas in this chapter, you must think about your work as product development. While many companies deliver software products to the market, you deliver services. We can perceive services as a product; they also obey the laws of supply and demand, and there are markets for different types of services.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p5">Like software products, you can decompose your activity into service features. Some of the aspects of your service that your team is good at will separate your department or company from your competitors, but you will likely find some of these aspects lagging behind other organizations that focus on this particular type of service. For example, a data science consulting company may shine in creating custom models. However, their <strong>user interfaces</strong> (<span><strong>UIs</strong></span>) will be worse than that of a specialized UI development company. These tradeoffs are justified by market demands: companies who want to buy services on a custom model development rarely need the same team to deliver a high-end UI.</p>
<p class="p5">Thinking about services as products opens up new possibilities for improvement. You can analyze your best service feature and think about the improvements that you can introduce to make your service better and more profitable, thereby opening up new possibilities for continuous service quality improvement.</p>
<p class="p5">In most cases, the best team delivers more functionality in less time and at a lower cost while being more customizable and better in quality than products that are optimized toward a broader market. As a service provider, you can do one thing that no product is capable of: creating solutions that are highly specialized for solving a specific problem for your customer. The question is, how can we make custom solutions easier to implement while not losing the key benefit of providing a custom solution to a customer's problem?</p>
<p>The first step of thinking about projects in terms of products is to consider the project's stage. In the next section, we will consider the concept of reusability in relation to different project types and stages. </p>

            <article>
                
<p class="p7">To develop the action plan of service improvement, you need to determine the type and stage of the project you are working on. We can divide projects into two major categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Custom solutions</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p7">While products are reusable by nature, often, custom solutions aren't. However, custom solutions can be built from reusable components while not losing the qualities of made-to-order software. To grow these internal components and improve reusability, you should care about them through each stage of the project:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Minimum viable product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>): Th<span class="s2">ink about the results of your previous projects that you can reuse while having a minimal investment of time.</span> Even if it looks like building this functionality from scratch will be easier, creating a reusable component can save you a lot more time over a longer time span.</li>
<li class="li8"><strong>Development</strong>: Think about what reusable components you can include in the system that you are building. Decide if any new functionality that you are building can be transformed into a reusable component.</li>
<li class="li5"><strong>Production</strong>: Stabilize and integrate any existing technology.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">The next big step in improving reusability is managing research. <span>The question that arises is: how do we decide when a project needs a research phase?</span> First, let's look at what kinds of research we can do in data science projects:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Data</strong>: Improving your understanding of customer's data by performing <strong>exploratory data analysis</strong> (<span><strong>EDA</strong>)</span> and searching for insights in data.</li>
<li class="li5"><strong>Models and algorithms</strong>: Improving your models and searching for new approaches to solving a problem.</li>
<li class="li5"><strong>Technology</strong>: Researching new technologies to improve your solution. Technology can be directly applicable to your project or supplement the development process by improving operations, requirement management, code or data versioning, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">Research is hard to plan and estimate, but it is necessary for finishing data science projects successfully. It opens up new opportunities, provides insights, and changes processes. Finding the right balance between research and implementation is crucial for the project's success. To manage research efficiently, you can split your project into two logical subprojects: research and solution development.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p5">You can integrate research phases into the solution development project in several ways, as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>In parallel with solution development</strong>: This approach requires a separate research team working full time. It is useful because the research process provides results in the background of the main project. Items from the research backlog that yielded good results are converted into research integration tasks in the main project backlog. This way of managing research is useful for data and model research because those activities can take a long time to finish and are straightforward to integrate into the main code base most of the time.</li>
<li class="li5"><strong>Before or after each development iteration</strong>: This approach requires your team to switch focus from solution development to research and is most effective when the results of the research can influence the long-term method of building the system. Technology research is the best candidate for this form of integration. You can tie technology research into software design stages so that your team can integrate new technologies into a project in a controlled manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, let's look at a way in which we can integrate research with implementation.</p>

<p>Lucas works as a data science team leader in a large retail company. He was asked to build a system that will help bring down the load on the support department, thereby solving the issues of 10,000 retail stores on a daily basis. The issue creation process in the department support portal is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose an issue category.</li>
<li>Fill in the template form.</li>
<li>Wait for the solution or information inquiry.</li>
<li>If you do not know the issue category, select <span class="packt_screen">No category</span> in the form and describe the issue in the free-form text box.</li>
</ol>
<p>The team has noticed that <span class="packt_screen">No category</span> issues are the most difficult and time-consuming for the support team to fix. This is because the free-form description often lacked the information that was requested by the templates, and so the support engineer needed to ask for a lot of additional information to determine the issue category and fill in the template form by himself. The idea was to use historical data to classify the incoming <span class="packt_screen">No category</span> issues and ask the user to fill in the information that's required by the template before sending the issue to the support department.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">The project had two major challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a text classifier that was capable of handling an extensive list of issue categories (more than 1,000)</li>
<li>Creating an issue classification system that would reliably operate on a 24/7 schedule and integrate this system with the company's support portal</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Lucas thought that the project actually consisted of two subprojects: research and system implementation. The research project had an unbounded time span and required the data scientists on the team to build various text classifiers and assess their quality. The main goal of the system implementation project was to build a highly available model server and change the company's support portal code so that they could integrate the model into the issue creation workflow.</p>
<p>Lucas has created two project teams for each project and created separate task backlogs for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The research team</strong>: The text classification task was not standard and did not have a direct solution because most pre-built text classification models can only handle a very limited number of classes and this project required the model to be stable with 1,000 classes. The research team had a team leader who managed and prioritized the research backlog so that the team would focus only on the most cost-effective and promising ideas. Everyone understood that this research could not have clear deadlines, so the team decided to use the artificial constraint of the general project deadline. The goal was to train the best possible text classifier, given the time constraints and the company's data.</li>
<li><strong>The implementation team</strong>: They were focused on building a software solution. It consisted of a machine learning engineer, backend software developer, UI software developer, a system analyst, and a team leader. Lucas decided that it would be best to use Scrum for this part of the project. The team discussed the deadlines, set up a fixed number of sprints, and made sure that they will be able to complete all the work during the time frame. The task was clear from a technical standpoint and didn't require extensive research or prototyping. The team had previously built model servers, so they decided to reuse their existing technology and add a few missing features.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The last question that remained was how they could integrate new re<span>search results into the system without breaking the system. This integration could easily become the project's bottleneck because the research team constantly switched data preprocessing methods and machine learning frameworks in search of the best result for the project. Lucas decided that the research team will need to provide their models as a software library with a fixed interface that's been designed and documented with the implementation team. This interface will</span><span> </span>establish the communications contract <span>between the research and implementation teams so that new model versions can be changed by simply updating the research team's library version.</span></p>
<p>After you have decided on the best approach for integrating research, along with the solution development process, and thought about which reusable components you can benefit from, you can move on and see how your team can gradually improve the reusability of the technology that you deliver. </p>

<p class="p9">Improving reusability is a custom project development setting where you develop and reuse internal components to build better solutions faster. Look at what parts of your work are repeated in all of your projects. For many companies, it's the model deployment and serving. For others, it is building the dashboards on top of the model.</p>
<p class="p9">Use open source projects as a starting point. In many fields, the best tools are provided by commercial companies. Thankfully, the data science community is a very open-minded group, and the best tools you can find are open source. Of course, there are great commercial products too, but you can build production-grade systems with state-of-the-art models using open solutions. They will give you a very solid foundation to build upon. </p>
<p class="p9">See if you can use those tools to decrease the total amount of time your team spends on similar repetitive activities over different projects. If you find that no open source solution solves your problem, then you have two options: build a reusable software component from scratch or buy a product. But how can you choose between buying a rebuilt solution versus building one for yourself? Prebuilt products are best suited for solving the common problems of data science teams. On the contrary, building custom internal reusable solutions should be left for the parts of the process that are unique to your team and company. To find a solution to your problem, you should look to open source solutions first, then to the product market, and lastly consider building a new technology internally.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p9">Keep in mind that reusable components require special care. As your toolchain grows, your team will need to spend more time supporting it. Reusable tools necessitate designing APIs and workflows that will stand the test of time. Maintaining reusable tools that are used in multiple projects is not an easy task, but it will allow your team to build upon itself, making each successive project more efficient than its predecessor.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><strong>To build or to buy?<br/>
<br/></strong> Often, your team will have this dilemma. You can build something yourself, use an open source solution, or buy a commercial product. This decision is never easy and has lasting consequences. Building something by yourself from scratch will require significant investment. You can cut corners by using an open source solution, but you may easily run into constraints or bugs that will force your team to dive into the development of this open source component. Trying to fix bugs or add features to large amounts of existing code that's been written by people from all around the world will require significant engineering efforts and will make switching to a different technology harder. Commercial products are the least customizable of the three, so your team must devote time to deciding which product matches your needs best.<br/>
<br/>
Things will be easier if you approach this decision analytically. Define success criteria and think about the strategic importance of the component or technology that you are planning to build, use, or buy. Define, document, and weigh all the pros and cons of having a complete picture. Finally, discuss the matter with as many stakeholders as you can, including your team members and management. </div>
<p>Reusable components can make your team a lot more efficient, without making your solutions generic, so that each client will have a customized service. Sometimes, you will spot an opportunity that will allow your team to make a jump into a totally different business model by turning the highly demanded custom solution into a product. In the next section, we will see how we can seek and build products. </p>

<p class="p9">Over time, it is natural to have teams that are dedicated to the development of the most complex and popular parts of your reusable toolchain. If you have a reusable component that has stood the test of time in multiple projects and is backed up by an experienced team, it is worth considering turning it into a product.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p9">Another sign that you should make products out of your projects is a high demand for some type of custom solution that you built. If every client asks you to build a customer support chatbot and you have already built tens of them, why not make a product to make everyone's lives easier?</p>
<p class="p9">If your company has no prior experience of delivering new products to the market, take this task seriously and be ready to transition into a new world. If you want to avoid mistakes, take the time to read the literature related to product management and consider hiring or consulting product managers that have the relevant experience. Product development differs from making a custom solution. In fact, it is an entirely different business, with processes and values that may seem bizarre to a consulting project manager.</p>
<p class="p9">Finally, remember that building products is risky and expensive. The product team will need to spend a substantial amount of effort converting any internal code base into a market-ready product. It the idea has no real market demand, this job will be a wasted effort.</p>
<p><span>Good product ideas are very attractive from a business perspective. However, if you provide services for different customers, you should always think about privacy before turning your projects into products for wide markets.</span></p>

<p class="p7">Privacy is of paramount importance for every data science team, especially for teams that are trusted by other businesses. When you're considering building a new product based on your internal code base or data, always check that everything you plan to use can be sold to other customers. If this is not the case, you may end up building the product from scratch, which will greatly increase the development costs. Ask your company's legal team if all the related NDAs and contracts allow for planned use cases.</p>
<p class="p7">You also need to consider licensing your internal reusable components so that you can legally reuse them across different projects. This book is not a legal consultant, so do not hesitate to consult with one if you plan to reuse software components and build products.</p>

<p class="p7">In this chapter, we have looked at the benefits of product thinking in a custom project development environment. We studied why reusability matters and how we can build and integrate reusable software components at each stage of the data science project. We also went over the topic of finding the right balance between research and implementation. Finally, we looked at strategies for improving the reusability of our projects and explored the conditions that allow us to build standalone products based on our experience.</p>

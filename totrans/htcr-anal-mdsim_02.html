<p>This chapter is mainly aimed at developers who have limited experience of healthcare. By the end of it, you will be able to describe basic characteristics of healthcare delivery in the United States, you will be familiar with specific legislation in the US that is relevant to analytics, you will understand how data in healthcare is structured, organized, and coded, and you will be aware of frameworks for thinking about analytics in healthcare.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare delivery in the US</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The healthcare industry impacts all of us, through its interactions with ourselves, our loved ones, our family, and our friends. The high costs associated with the healthcare industry are intertwined with the physical, emotional, and spiritual trauma that occurs when someone close to us becomes ill or feels pain.</p>
<p>In the United States, the healthcare system is in a fragile state, as healthcare expenditure exceeds 15% of the nation's total GDP; this proportion far exceeds that of other developed countries, and is expected to rise to at least 20% by the year 2040 (Braunstein, 2014; Bernaert, 2015). The rise in healthcare costs in the US, and internationally, can be attributed to several factors. One is a shift in demographics to a more elderly population. Average <strong>life expectancy</strong> (<strong>LE</strong>) rose to in excess of 80 years of age for the first time in 2011, up from 70 in 1970 (OECD, 2013). While this is a positive development, elderly patients are usually more prone to falling ill and are therefore more expensive in the eyes of the healthcare system. The second reason for rising costs is the increasing prevalence of serious chronic illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes (OECD, 2013), which increases the risk of other chronic conditions. Patients with chronic conditions account for the vast majority of healthcare expenditure (Braunstein, 2014). A third reason is misaligned incentives, which are discussed in the upcoming provider reimbursement section. A fourth reason is advancing technology, as the cost of equipment for performing expensive MRI imaging and CT scans have increased in all OECD countries (OECD, 2013).</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss some basic healthcare terminology and how healthcare is financed in the US.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare industry basics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Healthcare can be divided roughly into <strong>inpatient care</strong>, which is care that occurs in an overnight facility, such as a hospital, and <strong>outpatient</strong>, or <strong>ambulatory care</strong>, which is care that occurs on a same-day basis, usually in a physician’s office. Inpatient care is usually concerned with treating conditions that have progressed to a serious state or need complex interventions, and is usually costlier than outpatient care; therefore, a central goal in healthcare is to reduce the amount of care that occurs on an inpatient basis by emphasizing adequate preventive measures.</p>
<p>Another way to describe healthcare is by "stages of healthcare delivery." <strong>Primary care practitioners</strong> (<strong>PCPs</strong>) usually deal with the patient’s entire well-being and oversee all organ systems; in many care delivery models, they serve as "gatekeepers" to secondary and tertiary care providers. <strong>Secondary care</strong> denotes treatment by physicians specialized to treat certain diseases or organ systems, such as endocrinologists or cardiothoracic surgeons. <strong>Tertiary care</strong> is provided upon referral by a specialist and usually occurs in an inpatient setting at a facility specialized to treat very specific conditions, often via surgery.</p>
<p>Within healthcare, it takes a team of professionals, all having different roles, to provide optimal patient care. Physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, case managers, social workers, lab technicians, and information technology professionals are just some of the other personnel you will work with directly, or indirectly, in the healthcare analytics field.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare financing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A century ago, money used to flow directly from the patient to the provider for medical services provided. Today, however, healthcare finance is more complex, with employers and governments becoming increasingly involved, and new models emerging in relation to physician reimbursement. In the US, healthcare financing is no longer completely private; in order to assist the indigent and elderly populations, state and federal governments use taxes collected from citizens to fund <strong>Medicaid</strong> and <strong>Medicare</strong>, which are government-sponsored means of paying for healthcare for the poor and elderly, respectively. Once the money reaches the various third parties (insurance companies and/or the government), or while it is still in the possession of the patient, the money must be distributed to the physicians using a variety of payment models. In the following diagram, we provide a simplified overview of how money flows within the US healthcare system.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Much of the analytics in healthcare is a response to the increased emphasis on physician performance and quality, over quantity, of care:</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Fee-for-service reimbursement</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Traditionally, physicians were reimbursed using a <strong>fee-for-service</strong> (<strong>FFS</strong>) payment system, in which physicians were compensated for every test or procedure that they performed, regardless of whether their patients felt better after the tests or procedures. This reimbursement method leads to conflicting incentives for physicians, who are tasked with caring for their patient efficiently while, at the same time, earning a living. Many people attribute today's exorbitant US healthcare spending to FFS. Additionally, FFS reimbursement pays each physician individually, with minimal coordination between physicians. What happens if a patient sees two doctors for the same condition? Under FFS reimbursement, the physicians could order duplicate tests and be reimbursed separately.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Value-based care</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The shortcomings of FFS have led to a new vision for healthcare in the US—that of <strong>value-based care</strong>. Under a value-based reimbursement system, physicians are compensated based on the quality of care that they provide—which can be measured by their patient outcomes and the amount of money they save per patient. The incentive to order superfluous tests and procedures is gone, and the mutual goals of both the patient and physician become aligned. The value-based care umbrella includes a group of physician reimbursement models that reward physicians based on the quality of care provided, each with their own nuances. These models include <strong>accountable care organizations</strong> (<strong>ACOs</strong>), <strong>bundled payments</strong>, and <strong>patient-centered medical homes</strong> (<strong>PCMHs</strong>).</p>
<p>The important things to remember from this section are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United States and most other countries, healthcare expenses are growing in proportion to GDP</li>
<li>Value-based care is slowly becoming the new standard for physician compensation</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Healthcare policy</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Healthcare reform needs support from legislators if it is to succeed, and fortunately, it has received just that. In this section, let's take a look at some legislation that has paved the way for patients' rights and privacy, the rise of EMRs, value-based care, and the advancement of big data in healthcare, all of which are relevant to healthcare analytics.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Protecting patient privacy and patient rights</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Many countries around the world have enacted legislation for the protection of patient privacy. In the United States, legislation for protecting patient privacy was first signed into law in 1996 and is known as the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong>HIPAA</strong>). It has been revised and updated several times since then. Two of HIPAA’s main components are the <strong>Privacy Rule</strong> and the <strong>Security Rule</strong>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>The Privacy Rule states the specific situations for which healthcare data can be used. In particular, any information that can be used to identify the patient (known as <strong>protected health information</strong> (<strong>PHI</strong>)) can be freely used for the purposes of medical treatment, bill payments, or other certain healthcare operations. Any other uses of the data require written authorization from the patient. A covered entity is an organization that is required to comply with HIPAA law; examples of covered entities include care providers and insurance plans. In 2013, the <strong>Final Omnibus Rule</strong> extended the jurisdiction of HIPAA to include business associates or independent contractors of the covered entities (which most healthcare analytics professionals can be categorized under if working with clients in the United States). Therefore, if you work with healthcare data in the United States, you must protect your patients’ data or face the risk of fines and/or imprisonment.</p>
<p>If you are a healthcare analytics professional, how should you protect the <strong>electronic patient health information</strong> (<strong>e-PHI</strong>) in your data? The Security Rule answers this question. The Security Rule breaks down the safeguarding methods into three categories: administrative, physical, and technical. Specifically, according to the website of the US Department of Health and Human Services, healthcare data scientists should:</p>
<p>"ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI" in their possession; protect against "reasonably anticipated threats" to the security of the information and impermissible uses or disclosures; and "ensure compliance by their workforce"</p>
<p>(US Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). More specific information about safeguarding techniques can be found on the HHS website and includes the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Covered entities and business associates should designate a privacy officer in charge of HIPAA enforcement and maintain training programs for employees who have access to e-PHI</li>
<li>Access to hardware and software containing e-PHI should be carefully controlled, regulated, and limited to authorized individuals</li>
<li>e-PHI sent over open networks (for example, via email) must be encrypted</li>
<li>Covered entities and business associates are required to report any breaches of security to affected individuals and the Department of Health and Human Services</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the United States, there are many countries (particularly Canada and those in Europe) that have enacted healthcare privacy laws. Regardless of the country you live in, it’s considered ethical practice in healthcare analytics to protect your patients’ data and privacy.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Advancing the adoption of electronic medical records</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>EMRs, together with healthcare analytics, are seen as a possible remedy to escalating healthcare costs. In the United States, the major piece of legislation that has promoted the use of EMRs is the <strong>Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act</strong>, passed in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Braunstein, 2014). The HITECH Act provides incentive payments to healthcare organizations that do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt the use of "certified" <strong>electronic health records</strong> (<strong>EHRs</strong>)</li>
<li>Use the EHRs in a meaningful fashion. Starting in 2015, healthcare providers who did not use EHRs were subject to penalization from their Medicare reimbursement</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for an EHR to be certified, it must meet several dozen criteria. Examples of such criteria include those that support clinical practice, such as allowing for computerized physician order entry and recording demographic and clinical information about patients, such as medication lists, allergy lists, and smoking statuses. Other criteria focus on maintaining the privacy and security of medical information and they call for secure access, emergency access, and access timeout after a period of inactivity. The EHR should also be able to submit clinical quality measures to the appropriate authorities. Full lists of such criteria are available at <a href="http://www.healthit.gov">www.healthit.gov</a>.</p>
<p>It is not enough for providers to have access to a certified EHR; in order to receive incentive payments, providers must use the EHR in a <em>meaningful</em> fashion, as stipulated by the meaningful use requirements. Again, dozens of requirements exist, some of which are mandatory, and some optional. These requirements are distributed across the following five domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving care coordination</li>
<li>Reducing health disparities</li>
<li>Engaging patients and their families</li>
<li>Improving population and public health</li>
<li>Ensuring adequate privacy and security</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in part to the HITECH Act, the rise of EHRs will lead to an unprecedented volume of clinical information becoming available for subsequent analysis in efforts to cut costs and improve outcomes. Later in this chapter, we will explore the creation and formatting of this clinical information in more detail.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Promoting value-based care</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <strong>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</strong> (<strong>PPACA</strong>), also known as the <strong>Affordable Care Act</strong> (<strong>ACA</strong>), was passed in 2010. It is a mammoth piece of legislation that is most well-known for its attempt to reduce the uninsured population and to provide health insurance subsidies for the majority of citizens. Some of its lesser publicized provisions, however, added new value-based reimbursement models discussed earlier in the chapter (namely, bundled payments and accountable care organizations), and created the four original value-based programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program</strong> (<strong>HVBP</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Hospital Readmission Reduction Program</strong> (<strong>HRRP</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Program</strong> (<strong>HAC</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Value Modifier Program</strong> (<strong>VM</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These programs will be discussed in detail in <a href="023c1d7e-f3f0-42e6-a2be-64bd5ba4ab80.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Measuring Healthcare Quality</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015</strong> (<strong>MACRA</strong>) initiated the Quality Payment Program, composed of both the <strong>Alternative Payment Models</strong> (<strong>APM</strong>) program and the <strong>Merit-Based Incentive Payments System</strong> (<strong>MIPS</strong>). Both programs, which will be discussed in more detail in the <em>Measuring Provider Performance</em> chapter, moved the US healthcare system further away from FFS reimbursement toward value-based reimbursement.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Advancing analytics in healthcare</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are a handful of legal initiatives that are related to advancing analytics in healthcare. The most relevant of these is the <strong>All of Us</strong> initiative (formerly known as the <strong>Precision Medicine Initiative</strong>), which was enacted in 2015, and aims to collect health and genetic data from one million people by 2022 in an effort to advance precision medicine and medicine tailored to individuals.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following three initiatives, while not directly related to analytics, may indirectly increase funding for analytics research in healthcare. The <strong>Brain Initiative</strong>, passed in 2013, has the goal of radically improving our understanding of brain-related and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. <strong>Cancer Breakthroughs 2020</strong>, passed in 2016, is focused on finding vaccines and immunotherapies against cancer. And the <strong>21st Century Cures Act</strong> of 2016 streamlines the <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> (<strong>FDA</strong>) drug approval process, among other provisions.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Together, the legislation of the past three decades discussed previously has set the stage for revolutionizing how healthcare analytics is performed and has created new challenges to be solved by healthcare analytics, not only in the US, but also across the globe. The new reimbursement and financing methods task us with the problem of figuring out how healthcare can be performed more efficiently, given the data that we already have.</p>
<p>Now let's shift gears and see what clinical data is comprised of exactly.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Patient data – the journey from patient to computer</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The clinical data collection process starts when a patient starts telling a physician about his or her condition. This is known as the <strong>patient history</strong>, and since it is not observed directly by the physician, but instead recounted by the patient, the patient’s story is known as <strong>subjective information</strong>. In contrast, <strong>objective information</strong> comes from the physician and consists of the physician's own observations about the patient, from the physical examination, lab tests, and imaging studies, to other diagnostic procedures. Together, the subjective and objective information makes up the clinical note.</p>
<p>There are several types of clinical notes used in healthcare. The <strong>history and physical</strong> (<strong>H&amp;P</strong>) is the most thorough and comprehensive clinical note. It is usually obtained when an outpatient physician sees a patient for the first time, or when a patient is first admitted to the hospital. Collecting all the data from the patient and typing up the H&amp;P on the hospital computer may take a total of 1-2 hours for a single patient. Usually, an H&amp;P is only done once per physician/hospital admission. For successive outpatient visits, or an inpatient admission lasting several days, briefer clinical notes are compiled. These are termed <strong>progress notes</strong>, or <strong>SOAP notes</strong> (SOAP stands for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan). In these notes, the focus is on events that have occurred since the initial H&amp;P or the previous progress note.</p>
<p>Before patient data appears in your database, it makes a long journey, starting from the patient history as interpreted by the physician team. The patient story is combined with other pieces of information from different clinical departments (for example, laboratory, imaging) to form the <strong>electronic health record</strong> (<strong>EHR</strong>). When the hospital wants to make the data available to a third party for further analysis, it typically releases the data to the cloud in a database format.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Once the data is captured in a database system, the analytics professional can then use a variety of tools to visualize, pivot, analyze, and build predictive models:</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3969a86f-90ed-4b86-a845-ff8b2d90c016.png" style="width:56.58em;height:19.17em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">In the following subsections, we will describe the important aspects of these two types of clinical notes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The history and physical (H&amp;P)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As mentioned previously, the history and physical is the most comprehensive type of documentation available for patients and is usually conducted upon their admission to hospital and/or when seeing new outpatient physicians. The standard sections of the H&amp;P clinical note are discussed in the following sections.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Metadata and chief complaint</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The metadata includes basic information about the patient's visit, such as the patient’s name, date of birth, date/time of admission, and the name of the admitting hospital and attending physician.</p>
<p>The chief complaint is the reason for the patient’s visit/hospitalization, usually in the patient’s own words. Example: "I'm having some chest discomfort." This chief complaint may, or may not, be translated by the history taker into the corresponding medical terminology, for example, "chest pain."</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">History of the present illness (HPI)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The HPI includes details surrounding the chief complaint. This section is often split into two paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>The first paragraph provides the immediate details surrounding the chief complaint, usually using information obtained from the patient. The first sentence often provides important demographic details about the patient and any relevant details about the past medical history, in addition to the chief complaint. For example:</p>
<p>"Mr. Smith is a 53-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking, who presents to the emergency room complaining of chest pain."</p>
<p>Regarding the rest of the paragraph, a first HPI paragraph usually contains the seven standard elements listed here. These seven elements tend to assume that the chief complaint is some type of pain; some chief complaints (for example, amenorrhea) require different sets of questions. The seven elements are summarized in the following table:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">

</table>
<p> </p>
<p>The second paragraph should contain all the previous medical care the patient has already received for their ailment. Typical questions include: Have they seen a physician already or been hospitalized previously? What labs and tests were performed? How well controlled are the patient’s medical conditions relevant to the chief complaint? Which treatments were previously tried? Is there a copy of the x-ray?</p>

<p>This part of the H&amp;P lists all current and previous medical conditions that affect the patient, including, but not limited to, hospitalizations (whether for medical, surgical, or psychiatric reasons).</p>

<p>Current prescription and <strong>over-the-counter</strong> (<strong>OTC</strong>) medications are provided in this section, usually with the following details: medication name, dose, route of administration, and frequency. Every medication listed should correspond to one of the patient’s current medical conditions given in the past medical history. The route of administration and frequency are often written using abbreviations; refer to the following table for a list of common abbreviations.</p>

<p>The family history includes a disease history for family members up to two generations preceding the patient, with an emphasis on chronic diseases as well as diseases relevant to the chief complaint and the organ systems affected.</p>

<p>The social history provides details of social and risk factor information not obtained in the HPI. Included in this section are demographic factors not previously mentioned, occupation (and any occupational exposures to dangerous substances if applicable), social support (marriage, children, dependents), and substance use/abuse (tobacco, alcohol, recreational/illicit drugs).</p>

<p>The allergies section commonly includes substances to which the patient is hypersensitive, including drugs, and the corresponding reaction. If the patient has no known drug allergies, it is often abbreviated using the acronym NKDA.</p>

<p>The <strong>review of systems</strong> (<strong>ROS</strong>) serves as a final screening for significant symptoms after the other parts of the history have been obtained. In this section, the patient is asked about experiencing symptoms relevant to different functional organ systems of the body (for example, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary). An emphasis is placed on organ systems and symptoms relevant to the chief complaint. Symptoms for as many as 14 different organ systems may be touched upon.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Physical examination</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The physician proceeds to examine the patient and records the findings in this section. The description usually starts with general patient well-being and appearance, followed by pertinent vital signs (see table for additional details), before proceeding with the <strong>head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat</strong> (<strong>HEENT</strong>), and continuing down the body with specific organs/organ systems.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Additional objective data (lab tests, imaging, and other diagnostic tests)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The physical examination marks the beginning of what is called objective data, or data about the patient that is observed, interpreted, and recorded by the physician. This is in contrast to subjective data, which is information provided to the physician by the patient first-hand, and which includes the patient history. After the physical examination, all additional objective data about the patient is provided. This includes the results of any lab tests, imaging studies if applicable, and any other tests specific to the present illness that may have been performed. Common imaging studies include <strong>x-rays</strong> (<strong>XR</strong>), <strong>computed tomography</strong> (<strong>CT</strong>) scans, and <strong>magnetic resonance imaging</strong> (<strong>MRI</strong>) scans of the body region of interest.</p>

<p>This is the final part of the H&amp;P. In the assessment, the physician consolidates all of the subjective and objective data of the previous sections to make a concise summary of the chief complaint, along with significant findings from the history, physical examination, and additional tests. The physician lists the most likely causes of the patient’s condition, in an itemized manner for each distinct group of complaints/findings. In the plan, the physician discusses the blueprint for treating the patient, again in an itemized fashion.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The progress (SOAP) clinical note</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The SOAP note, as stated previously, is typically done on a daily basis for patients admitted to a hospital and includes one section for every letter in its acronym: <strong>subjective, objective, assessment, and plan</strong> (<strong>SOAP</strong>). The subjective section focuses on any new complaints the patient is having, or had, on the previous night. The objective section includes the daily and focused physical examination and lab, imaging, and test results from the previous day. The assessment and plan are similar to those of the H&amp;P, updated from previous notes with all of the day's events taken into consideration.</p>
<p>At the end of the note documentation process, valuable information about the patient has been collected and recorded in the EMR. Before the data is tabulated, however, it is usually integrated with clinical codesets. Let's discuss clinical codesets in the next section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Standardized clinical codesets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Being philosophical for a moment, every known object that has a significant importance attributed to it has a name. The organs you are using to read these words are known as eyes. The words are written on pieces of paper called pages. To turn the pages, you use your hands. These are all objects that we have named so that we can identify them easily.</p>
<p>In healthcare, important entities—diseases, procedures, lab tests, drugs, symptoms, bacteria species, for example, have names and identities too. For example, the failure of the heart valves to pump blood to the rest of the body is known as heart failure. ACE inhibitors are a class of drugs used to treat heart failure.</p>
<p>A problem arises, however, when healthcare industry workers associate the same entity with different identities. For example, one physician may refer to "heart failure" as "congestive heart failure", while another may refer to it as "CHF." Also, there are varying levels of specificity: a third doctor may call it "systolic heart failure" to indicate that the dysfunction is occurring during the systolic phase of the heartbeat. In medicine, accuracy and specificity are of the utmost importance. How can we ensure that all members of the healthcare team are talking and thinking about the same thing? The answer lies in clinical codes.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical codes</strong> can be thought of as unique identities for medical concepts. Each code is typically comprised of a pair of objects: an alphanumeric code and a verbal description of the entity that the code represents. For example, in the ICD10-CM coding system, the code I50.9 represents "Heart failure, unspecified." There are additional, more specific codes to represent more specific heart failure diagnoses when they are known.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are likely thousands of different coding systems that exist in the world, many of them being used only in the specific healthcare organization at which they were conceived. Fortunately, to ease confusion and promote interoperability, there are several well-known coding systems that are seen as national/international standards. Some of the more important standardized coding systems include <strong>International Classification of Disease</strong> (<strong>ICD</strong>) for medical diagnoses, <strong>Current Procedural Terminology</strong> (<strong>CPT</strong>) for medical procedures, <strong>Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes</strong> (<strong>LOINC</strong>) for laboratory tests, <strong>National Drug Code</strong> (<strong>NDC</strong>) for drug therapies, and <strong>Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine</strong> (<strong>SNOMED</strong>) for all of the preceding and more. In this section, we explore each of these coding systems in a little more detail.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">International Classification of Disease (ICD)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Diseases and conditions are usually coded using the ICD coding system. ICD was started in 1899 and is revised (every 10 years) and maintained by the <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (<strong>WHO</strong>). As of 2016, the tenth revision (ICD-10) is the most recent, and consists of more than 68,000 unique diagnostic codes, more than any previous revision.</p>
<p>ICD-10 codes may consist of up to eight alphanumeric characters. The first three characters indicate the major disease category; for example, "N18" specifies chronic kidney disease. These characters are followed by a period and then the remaining characters, which can provide an extraordinary amount of clinical detail (Braunstein, 2014). For example, code "C50.211" specifies "malignant neoplasm of upper-inner quadrant of the right female breast." With all of its precision, ICD-10 facilitates the application of analytics in healthcare.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Medical, surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures are coded using the CPT coding system. Developed by the <strong>American Medical Association</strong> (<strong>AMA</strong>), CPT codes consist of four numeric characters followed by a fifth alphanumeric character. Commonly used CPT codes include those for outpatient visits, surgical procedures, radiological tests, anesthetic procedures, history and physical examination, and emerging technologies. Unlike the ICD, the CPT is not a hierarchical coding system. Some concepts, however, have multiple codes depending on factors such as the visit length (for outpatient visits) or the amount of tissue removed (for surgical procedures).</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Laboratory tests and observations are coded using the LOINC coding system. Written and maintained by the Regenstrief Institute, there are over 70,000 codes, each of which is a six-digit number, the last number being separated by the other numbers with a hyphen. Like CPT codes, a specific type of laboratory test (or example, <strong>white blood cell</strong> (<strong>WBC</strong>) count) often has multiple codes that vary, depending on the timing of the sample, the measurement units, the measurement method, and so on. While each code contains a large amount of information, this may pose a problem when trying to find a code for a lab test such as a WBC count when not all of the relevant information is known.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">National Drug Code (NDC)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The NDC is maintained by the US FDA. Each code is 10 digits long and has three subcomponents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A labeler component, which identifies the manufacturer/distributor of the drug</li>
<li>A product component, which identifies the actual drug from the labeler, including strength, dosage, and formulation</li>
<li>A package code, which identifies the specific package shape and size</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the three subcomponents can uniquely identify any medication that is approved by the FDA.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>SNOMED-CT is a huge coding system that uniquely identifies over 300,000 clinical concepts. These concepts may be diseases, procedures, labs, drugs, organs, infectious agents, infections, symptoms, clinical findings, and more. Additionally, SNOMED-CT defines over 1.3 million relationships between these concepts. SNOMED-CT is maintained by the <strong>National Institutes of Health</strong> (<strong>NIH</strong>) and is a subset of an even larger coding system, SNOMED, which includes concepts not relevant to clinical practice. The NIH has a software program called MetaMap (<a href="https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/">https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/</a>), which can be used to tag clinical concepts appearing in text, making it useful for natural language processing in healthcare.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>While coding systems cannot uniquely identify every clinical concept with all of their variations and nuances, they come reasonably close, and, in so doing, make certain activities in medicine (particularly billing and analytics) much easier. In <a href="d029d858-9c6e-4bf0-b793-87cdc4395e86.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Making Healthcare Predictive Models</em>, we will use some coding systems to make predictive models for healthcare.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered healthcare fundamentals, in the next section, we will present frameworks for thinking specifically about healthcare analytics.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Breaking down healthcare analytics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So you've decided to enter the world of analytics, and you know you want to focus on the healthcare industry. However, that barely narrows down the problem space, as there are hundreds of open problems in healthcare that are being addressed with machine learning and other analytical tools. If you have ever typed the words "machine learning in healthcare" into Google or PubMed, you have probably discovered how vast the ocean of machine learning use cases in healthcare is. In academia, publications focus on problems ranging from predicting dementia onset in the elderly to predicting the occurrence of a heart attack within six months to predicting which antidepressants patients will best respond to. How do you pick the problem on which to focus? This section is all about answering that question. Choosing the appropriate problem to solve is the first essential step in healthcare analytics.</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In healthcare, the problems to solve can be broken down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population</li>
<li>Medical task</li>
<li>Data format</li>
<li>Disease</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">We review each of these components in this section.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Population</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Unfortunately, research studies cannot address every human patient on the planet, and machine learning models are no exception. In healthcare, patient <strong>populations</strong> are what make groups of patients, and therefore, their data and disease characteristics—homogeneous. Examples of patient populations include inpatients, outpatients, emergency room patients, children, adults, and US citizens. Geographically, populations can even be defined at the state, municipal, or local levels.</p>
<p>What would happen if you tried to do modeling across different populations? Data from separate populations hardly ever overlap. First of all, it may be difficult to collect the same set of features across various populations. Some of the data may simply not be collected for certain populations. If you were trying to combine inpatient and outpatient populations, for example, you wouldn't get hourly blood pressure readings or intake/output measurements for your outpatients. In addition, another contributing problem is that data for different populations will most likely come from different sources, and you probably already know that the chance of two different data sources sharing many common features is low. How can you build a model based on patients who don't have the same features? Even if there is a shared lab test, for example, variations in how the lab quantity is measured and the units in which it is expressed make it nearly impossible to produce a homogeneous, coherent dataset.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Medical task</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In healthcare practice, the evaluation and treatment of patients can be broken down into different cognitive subtasks. Each of these tasks can potentially be aided by using analytics. Screening, diagnosis, prognosis measurement, outcome measurement, and response to treatment are some of these basic tasks, and we will look at each one in turn.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Screening</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Screening</strong> can be defined as the identification of a disease in a patient before the onset of signs and symptoms. This is important because in many diseases, particularly chronic diseases, early detection coincides with early treatment, better outcomes, and lower costs to the healthcare provider.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Screening for some diseases has greater potential benefits than screening for others. In order for disease screening to be worthwhile, several conditions, as listed here, must be met (Martin <em>et al.</em>, 2005):</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome must be alterable at the time of identifying the disease</li>
<li>The screening technique should be cost-effective</li>
<li>The test should have high accuracy (see <a href="46c83498-cb6e-45b4-ac39-6875a8d32400.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Machine Learning Foundations</em> for methods for measuring test accuracy in healthcare)</li>
<li>The disease should carry a large burden on the population</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a popular screening problem and solution is using the Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer; women are recommended to undergo this cost-effective test every 1-3 years throughout most of their lives. Lung cancer screening is an example of a problem that has yet to find an ideal solution; while using x-rays to screen for lung cancer may be accurate and may lead to earlier detection in some cases, x-rays are costly and expose patients to radiation, and there is no strong evidence that early detection influences the prognosis or outcome (Martin <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Increasingly, machine learning models are being developed in lieu of medical tests to screen for diseases including cancer, heart disease, and strokes (Esfandiari <em>et al.</em>, 2014).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Diagnosis</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> can be defined as the identification of a disease in an individual. In contrast to screening, diagnosis may happen at any time during the course of the disease. Diagnosis is important for almost every disease because it dictates how the signs or symptoms (and the underlying disease) should be treated. The exception occurs when diseases have no effective treatment, or when differentiating between diseases does not change the treatment.</p>
<p>A common use of machine learning in diagnosis problems is to identify potential causes of underlying disease in the face of a mysterious symptom, for example, abdominal pain. In contrast, building a machine learning model to differentiate between different types of psychiatric personality disorders may be of limited efficacy, since personality disorders are difficult to treat effectively.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Outcome/Prognosis</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As discussed earlier in this chapter, healthcare is primarily concerned with producing better outcomes at a lower cost. Often, we try to determine which patients are at a high risk of a poor outcome directly, without necessarily focusing on the specific cause of their signs and symptoms. Popular outcomes for which machine learning solutions are being applied include predicting which patients will likely be readmitted to a hospital, which patients will suffer death, and which patients will be admitted to the hospital from the emergency room. As we will see in <a href="023c1d7e-f3f0-42e6-a2be-64bd5ba4ab80.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Measuring Healthcare Quality</em>, many of these outcomes are actively monitored by governments and healthcare organizations and, in some cases, governments even provide financial incentives to improve specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Often, instead of dividing outcomes into two classes (for example, readmission versus non-readmission), we can attempt to quantify a patient's chances of survival in terms of a specific time period, given the characteristics of the patient's disease. For example, in cancer and heart failure patients, you can attempt to predict for how many years the patient is likely to survive. This is referred to as <strong>prognosis</strong>, and it is also a popular machine learning problem in healthcare.</p>

<p>In healthcare, diseases often have a variety of treatments, and predicting which treatment a patient will respond to is a problem in itself. For example, cancer patients can undergo a variety of chemotherapy regimens, and depressed patients have dozens of pharmacological treatments to choose from. Although this is a machine learning problem that is still in its infancy, it is gaining popularity and is also known as personalized medicine.</p>

<p>Machine learning use cases in healthcare also vary, depending on the format of the available data. The data format often dictates what methods and algorithms can be used to solve the problem, and therefore plays an important part in determining the use case.</p>

<p>When we think of machine learning, we usually think of the data as having a structured format. <strong>Structured data</strong> is data that can be organized into rows and columns having discrete values. Much of the patient data in an electronic health record may be stored in, or converted to, this format. In healthcare, individual patients or encounters often form the rows (or observations), and various features (for example, demographic variables, clinical characteristics, lab observations) of the patient/encounter form the columns. Such a format is particularly conducive to performing machine learning analyses using various algorithms.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unstructured</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Unfortunately, much of the data in an EHR (such as that in a clinical note) consists of free-form text; this is known as <strong>unstructured data</strong>. Provider notes generated as part of healthcare delivery provide extensive information regarding the patient and the progress of a hospital visit. Depending on the complexity of the diagnoses, radiology reports, pathology reports, and other diagnoses, notes would also include unstructured information. While unstructured data is capable of communicating far more extensive and valuable information about the patient, analysis of such data poses much more of a challenge than that of structured data.</p>

<p>In certain specialties, such as radiology and pathology, data is collected using photographs and images of disease, using either photographs of lesions, pathological slides, or x-ray images. An emerging area is the automated analysis of this image data to screen, diagnose, and measure the prognosis of various diseases using these images, including benign and malignant cancers, heart disease, and strokes. We discuss examples of this in the book's final chapter.</p>

<p>The <strong>electrophysiological signal collection</strong> is yet another data modality in healthcare; collection and analysis of such signals, be it <strong>electroencephalographic</strong> (<strong>EEG</strong>) signals in epilepsy patients, or <strong>electrocardiographic</strong> (<strong>EKG</strong>) signals in heart attack patients, can be valuable for disease diagnosis and prognosis measurement. In 2014, the popular data science competition website, Kaggle, offered a $10,000 prize for the data science team that could most effectively predict seizures in epilepsy patients using EEG data.</p>

<p>A fourth way in which use cases are permuted in healthcare is according to the disease. Thousands of medical diseases are actively being studied in medical research, and each one represents a potential target for machine learning models. However, in machine learning, not all diseases are created equal; some promise better potential rewards and opportunities than others.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Acute versus chronic diseases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In healthcare, diseases are often classified as being acute or chronic (Braunstein, 2014). Both types of disease are important targets for predictive modeling. <strong>Acute diseases</strong> are characterized by a sudden onset, are usually self-limited, and patients often experience a full recovery after the appropriate treatment. Also, risk factors for acute conditions are often not determined by patient behavior. Examples of acute diseases include influenza, kidney stones, and appendicitis.</p>
<p><strong>Chronic diseases</strong>, in contrast, typically have a progressive onset and last for the lifetime of the patient. They are influenced by patient behavior, such as smoking and obesity, and also by genetic factors. Examples of chronic diseases include hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Chronic diseases are particularly dangerous because they tend to be linked and cause other serious chronic and acute diseases. Chronic diseases are also costly to society; billions of dollars are spent annually on preventing and treating common chronic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Acute-on-chronic diseases</strong> are particularly popular in healthcare predictive modeling. These are acute, sudden onset diseases that are caused by chronic conditions. For example, stroke and myocardial infarction are acute conditions that are by-products of the chronic conditions hypertension and diabetes. Acute-on-chronic disease modeling is popular because it allows us to filter the population to a high-risk group that has the corresponding chronic condition, increasing the yield of predictive models. For example, if you were trying to predict the onset of <strong>congestive heart failure</strong> (<strong>CHF</strong>), a useful starting place would be patients that have hypertension, which is a major risk factor. This would lead to a model with a higher percentage of true-positives than if you were to randomly sample the population. In other words, if we were trying to predict CHF onset, it wouldn't be very useful to include healthy 20-year-old males in our model.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Cancer</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are several reasons why predictive modeling for cancer has become an important use case. For one thing, cancer is the second leading cause of death among medical diseases, just behind heart attacks. It's insidious onset and course makes cancer diagnosis just that bit more surprising and devastating. No one can dispute the importance of fighting cancer with every tool in our arsenal, and that includes machine learning methods.</p>
<p>Second, within cancer machine learning, there are a variety of use cases that are well-suited to being solved by machine learning. For example, given a healthy patient, how likely is that patient to develop a particular type of cancer? Given a patient that has just been diagnosed with cancer, can we inexpensively predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant? How long can the patient be expected to survive? Will they likely be alive in 5 years? 10 years? To which, chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimen is the patient most likely to respond? What is the chance of cancer recurring once it is successfully treated? Questions like these benefit from mathematical answers that may be beyond the capabilities of a single doctor's reasoning or even that of a panel of doctors.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Other diseases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Certainly, there are other diseases that stand to benefit from predictive modeling. An additional point to remember is that some diseases that are particularly burdensome to society (for example, asthma and chronic kidney disease) are of particular interest to administrators and are being very actively funded and studied by both public agencies at the national, state, and local levels, as well as by private corporations.</p>

<p>Now that we've seen some of the ways in which machine learning problems can vary in healthcare, it becomes easier to specify a problem. Once you've selected a population, a medical task, an outcome measure, and disease, you can formulate a machine learning problem with a reasonable amount of specificity. We haven't included our choice of an algorithm in our discussion because, technically, it is separate from the problem being solved, and also because many problems are approached by using multiple algorithms. We will look at specific machine learning algorithms in Chapters 3 and 7, which will provide you with some background for choosing algorithms.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here are some example use cases that can be specified using the preceding information:</p>
<p>"I'd like to predict which healthy elderly adults are likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the next five years."</p>
<p>"We are going to build a model that looks at images of moles and predicts whether the moles are likely to be benign or malignant."</p>
<p>"Can we predict whether pediatric patients presenting to the emergency room with asthma will be admitted to the hospital or discharged home?"</p>

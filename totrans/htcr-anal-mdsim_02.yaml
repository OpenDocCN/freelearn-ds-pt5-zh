    our loved ones, our family, and our friends. The high costs associated with the
    healthcare industry are intertwined with the physical, emotional, and spiritual
    trauma that occurs when someone close to us becomes ill or feels pain.

- en: In the United States, the healthcare system is in a fragile state, as healthcare
    expenditure exceeds 15% of the nation's total GDP; this proportion far exceeds
    that of other developed countries, and is expected to rise to at least 20% by
    the year 2040 (Braunstein, 2014; Bernaert, 2015). The rise in healthcare costs
    in the US, and internationally, can be attributed to several factors. One is a
    shift in demographics to a more elderly population. Average **life expectancy**
    (**LE**) rose to in excess of 80 years of age for the first time in 2011, up from
    70 in 1970 (OECD, 2013). While this is a positive development, elderly patients
    are usually more prone to falling ill and are therefore more expensive in the
    eyes of the healthcare system. The second reason for rising costs is the increasing
    prevalence of serious chronic illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes (OECD, 2013),
    which increases the risk of other chronic conditions. Patients with chronic conditions
    account for the vast majority of healthcare expenditure (Braunstein, 2014). A
    third reason is misaligned incentives, which are discussed in the upcoming provider
    reimbursement section. A fourth reason is advancing technology, as the cost of
    equipment for performing expensive MRI imaging and CT scans have increased in
    all OECD countries (OECD, 2013).

    occurs in an overnight facility, such as a hospital, and **outpatient**, or **ambulatory
    care**, which is care that occurs on a same-day basis, usually in a physician’s
    office. Inpatient care is usually concerned with treating conditions that have
    progressed to a serious state or need complex interventions, and is usually costlier
    than outpatient care; therefore, a central goal in healthcare is to reduce the
    amount of care that occurs on an inpatient basis by emphasizing adequate preventive
    measures.

- en: Another way to describe healthcare is by "stages of healthcare delivery." **Primary
    care practitioners** (**PCPs**) usually deal with the patient’s entire well-being
    and oversee all organ systems; in many care delivery models, they serve as "gatekeepers"
    to secondary and tertiary care providers. **Secondary care** denotes treatment
    by physicians specialized to treat certain diseases or organ systems, such as
    endocrinologists or cardiothoracic surgeons. **Tertiary care** is provided upon
    referral by a specialist and usually occurs in an inpatient setting at a facility
    specialized to treat very specific conditions, often via surgery.

    to provide optimal patient care. Physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,
    nurses, case managers, social workers, lab technicians, and information technology

    for medical services provided. Today, however, healthcare finance is more complex,
    with employers and governments becoming increasingly involved, and new models
    emerging in relation to physician reimbursement. In the US, healthcare financing
    is no longer completely private; in order to assist the indigent and elderly populations,
    state and federal governments use taxes collected from citizens to fund **Medicaid**
    and **Medicare**, which are government-sponsored means of paying for healthcare
    for the poor and elderly, respectively. Once the money reaches the various third
    parties (insurance companies and/or the government), or while it is still in the
    possession of the patient, the money must be distributed to the physicians using
    a variety of payment models. In the following diagram, we provide a simplified
    overview of how money flows within the US healthcare system.

    payment system, in which physicians were compensated for every test or procedure
    that they performed, regardless of whether their patients felt better after the
    tests or procedures. This reimbursement method leads to conflicting incentives
    for physicians, who are tasked with caring for their patient efficiently while,
    at the same time, earning a living. Many people attribute today's exorbitant US
    healthcare spending to FFS. Additionally, FFS reimbursement pays each physician
    individually, with minimal coordination between physicians. What happens if a
    patient sees two doctors for the same condition? Under FFS reimbursement, the
    physicians could order duplicate tests and be reimbursed separately.

    of **value-based care**. Under a value-based reimbursement system, physicians
    are compensated based on the quality of care that they provide—which can be measured
    by their patient outcomes and the amount of money they save per patient. The incentive
    to order superfluous tests and procedures is gone, and the mutual goals of both
    the patient and physician become aligned. The value-based care umbrella includes
    a group of physician reimbursement models that reward physicians based on the
    quality of care provided, each with their own nuances. These models include **accountable
    care organizations** (**ACOs**), **bundled payments**, and **patient-centered
    medical homes** (**PCMHs**).

- en: Many countries around the world have enacted legislation for the protection
    of patient privacy. In the United States, legislation for protecting patient privacy
    was first signed into law in 1996 and is known as the **Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act** (**HIPAA**). It has been revised and updated several
    times since then. Two of HIPAA’s main components are the **Privacy Rule** and
    the **Security Rule**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Privacy Rule states the specific situations for which healthcare data can
    be used. In particular, any information that can be used to identify the patient
    (known as **protected health information** (**PHI**)) can be freely used for the
    purposes of medical treatment, bill payments, or other certain healthcare operations.
    Any other uses of the data require written authorization from the patient. A covered
    entity is an organization that is required to comply with HIPAA law; examples
    of covered entities include care providers and insurance plans. In 2013, the **Final
    Omnibus Rule** extended the jurisdiction of HIPAA to include business associates
    or independent contractors of the covered entities (which most healthcare analytics
    professionals can be categorized under if working with clients in the United States).
    Therefore, if you work with healthcare data in the United States, you must protect
    your patients’ data or face the risk of fines and/or imprisonment.

    physician about his or her condition. This is known as the **patient history**,
    and since it is not observed directly by the physician, but instead recounted
    by the patient, the patient’s story is known as **subjective information**. In
    contrast, **objective information** comes from the physician and consists of the
    physician's own observations about the patient, from the physical examination,
    lab tests, and imaging studies, to other diagnostic procedures. Together, the
    subjective and objective information makes up the clinical note.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several types of clinical notes used in healthcare. The **history
    and physical** (**H&P**) is the most thorough and comprehensive clinical note.
    It is usually obtained when an outpatient physician sees a patient for the first
    time, or when a patient is first admitted to the hospital. Collecting all the
    data from the patient and typing up the H&P on the hospital computer may take
    a total of 1-2 hours for a single patient. Usually, an H&P is only done once per
    physician/hospital admission. For successive outpatient visits, or an inpatient
    admission lasting several days, briefer clinical notes are compiled. These are
    termed **progress notes**, or **SOAP notes** (SOAP stands for subjective, objective,
    assessment, and plan). In these notes, the focus is on events that have occurred
    since the initial H&P or the previous progress note.

    procedures, radiological tests, anesthetic procedures, history and physical examination,
    and emerging technologies. Unlike the ICD, the CPT is not a hierarchical coding

    Data from separate populations hardly ever overlap. First of all, it may be difficult
    to collect the same set of features across various populations. Some of the data
    may simply not be collected for certain populations. If you were trying to combine
    inpatient and outpatient populations, for example, you wouldn't get hourly blood
    pressure readings or intake/output measurements for your outpatients. In addition,
    another contributing problem is that data for different populations will most
    likely come from different sources, and you probably already know that the chance
    of two different data sources sharing many common features is low. How can you
    build a model based on patients who don't have the same features? Even if there
    is a shared lab test, for example, variations in how the lab quantity is measured
    and the units in which it is expressed make it nearly impossible to produce a

    patients often experience a full recovery after the appropriate treatment. Also,

    Examples of acute diseases include influenza, kidney stones, and appendicitis.

    diseases are particularly dangerous because they tend to be linked and cause other

    modeling is popular because it allows us to filter the population to a high-risk
    group that has the corresponding chronic condition, increasing the yield of predictive
    models. For example, if you were trying to predict the onset of **congestive heart
    failure** (**CHF**), a useful starting place would be patients that have hypertension,
    which is a major risk factor. This would lead to a model with a higher percentage
    of true-positives than if you were to randomly sample the population. In other

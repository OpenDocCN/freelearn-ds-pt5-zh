            <article class="calibre2">
                
<p class="calibre4">Today, if you ask any data scientist about the statistical methods, (or even a few) you will most likely discover that there are two most well-known statistical methods used within the practice of data science and the statistics industry today for predictive modeling. We introduced these two methods in <a href="8a0b3272-dfa0-46ca-9e90-f6050f2007cd.xhtml" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">Chapter 6</a><em class="calibre21">, Database Progression to Database Regression</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These two methods are as follows:</p>
<ul class="calibre18">
<li class="calibre19">Linear regression</li>
<li class="calibre19">Logistic regression</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre4">The <strong class="calibre7">linear regression</strong> method is probably considered to be the <em class="calibre21">classic</em> or most common starting point for problems, where the goal is to predict a numerical quantity. The <strong class="calibre7">Linear Regression</strong> (or <strong class="calibre7">LR</strong>) model is based on a linear combination of input features.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The <strong class="calibre7">logistic regression</strong> method uses a nonlinear transformation of this linear feature combination in order to restrict the range of the output in the interval [0, 1]. In doing so, it predicts the probability that the output belongs to one of two classes. Thus, it is a very well-known technique for classification.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Recall that classification is the process of recognizing to which set of categories (or sub-populations) a new or different observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Both of these methods have their individual strengths, but both also share the same disadvantage in that they are not very good at predicting if they have to deal with the situation of a high volume of input features.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this chapter (as an alternative to linear and logistic regression), we want to introduce the concept of ANNs, which is technically a nonlinear approach to solving both regression and classification problems.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They (ANNs) are significantly more robust when dealing with a higher dimensional input feature space and, for classification, they possess a <strong class="calibre7">natural</strong> way to handle more than two output classes. We'll talk more about the advantages of <span class="calibre14"> ANNs</span> later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Artificial neural networks are a <strong class="calibre7">biologically inspired</strong> statistical method or model (based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks), with their roots dating all the way back to the 1940s.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Another interesting viewpoint:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">Neural Networks are a machine learning framework that attempts to mimic the learning pattern of natural biological neural networks.<br class="calibre2"/>
                                                                          - Jose Portilla, Udemy Data Science Instructor.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Interest in artificial neural networks has varied greatly since then--mostly because the first artificial neural network models were very rudimentary and therefore found to be limited in practice compared to the expectations at the time.</p>
<div class="packt_quote">Neural networks have not always been popular, partly because they were, and still are in some cases, computationally expensive and partly because they did not seem to yield better results when compared with simpler methods such as <strong class="calibre3">support vector machines</strong> (<strong class="calibre3">SVMs</strong>). Nevertheless, neural networks have, once again, raised attention and become popular.<br class="calibre2"/>
                                                                                      -Michy Alice, September 2015.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Furthermore, training a large artificial neural network does necessitate substantial computational resources. Recently, there has been a huge resurgence in the interest in artificial neural networks as distributed on-demand computing resources are now becoming widespread, and an important area of machine learning, known as <strong class="calibre7">deep learning</strong>, is already extremely popular and showing great promise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The timing is right!</p>
<p class="calibre4">For this reason, it is a great time for a data developer to begin learning about<span class="calibre14"> ANNs</span> models.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Deep learning (also known as <strong class="calibre3">deep structured learning</strong>, <strong class="calibre3">hierarchical learning</strong>, or <strong class="calibre3">deep machine learning</strong>) is a class of machine learning algorithms that use a cascade of many layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning</a>).</div>

<p class="calibre4">Our approach is to always start with a solid definition. So--what exactly is an artificial neural network? Perhaps:</p>
<p class="calibre4">A computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A popular understanding or, if we check online for a definition:</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre21">In machine learning and cognitive science, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of models inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular, the brain) and are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown.</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">So there are many definitions, but in summarization, the common theme through all of the definitions you'll find for an <span class="calibre14"> ANNs</span> is that it is defined as a computer data model based upon the concepts of how a human brain works.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As the preceding screenshot suggests, the construction of a typical artificial neural network is based on some number of the following:</p>

<p class="calibre4">Each of the layers is made up of a number of interconnected nodes--each node containing what is referred to as an <strong class="calibre7">activation function</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There will be at least one node in the input layer for each predictor variable that exists within the data. The input nodes feed the input values (the <strong class="calibre7">problem to be solved</strong>) to each of the nodes in the (next) hidden layer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The input(s) to each node are summed to give a single value, <em class="calibre21"><span class="calibre14">x</span></em>.

<p class="calibre4">There are a number of functions that can be used in artificial neural network nodes, including the radial basis function or a simple linear function, but the most common is the sigmoid or logistic function.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A sigmoid function is typically the most common and perhaps easiest to understand. The sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic S-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. Sigmoid functions have a domain of all real numbers, with the return value monotonically increasing most often from 0 to 1 or alternatively from −1 to 1, depending on convention.

<p class="calibre4">The nodes within an artificial neural network will always produce or calculate a value between 0 and 1, so the output of a node can only ever be in the collection 0 to 1.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Recalling from the previous section describing artificial neural network nodes, if all the nodes work the same way or, at least produce the same result (0 or 1), how does the network differentiate between classes?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It uses assigned weights to each node's inputs. This is a feature (or variable in the data) that can have a large or small weighting, which then results in varying the contribution that the variable or feature makes to the <em class="calibre21">sum</em> in any node.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In practice, a variable can be assigned a large weight feeding into one node and an almost zero weight feeding into another node, which would mean that the variable would have a strong influence on the first and practically none on the second.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sigmoid function (which we also mentioned in the previous section) indicates that the node's output switches from a zero to a one when its <em class="calibre21">x</em> value crosses a threshold. This can transpire in numerous ways, such as if one highly weighted input has a high value or if a collection of medium-weighted inputs have high values.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Training the artificial neural network is the process of systematically discovering the best values of weights to maximize the accurateness of classification.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The value coming out of a node in the hidden layer is multiplied by a weight associated with the node that did the calculation and adds to the weighted values of other nodes. This summation becomes the artificial neural network model's output or solution. (Observe that the term used for this varies between data scientists, some say output, others solution, result, or even outcome).</p>
<p class="calibre4">Again, the problems are presented to the artificial neural network (through the model's input layer), which will communicate to one or (most likely) more hidden layers where the actual processing is done via a system of weighted connections. The hidden layers then link to an output layer where the solution is given.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Most artificial neural network models contain some form of an algorithm that governs how the model <strong class="calibre7">learns</strong>.

<p class="calibre4">This <strong class="calibre7">adjusting of the node's weights</strong> (some call <strong class="calibre7">right-regulating</strong>) is similar to the idea of learning to recognize an image (or <strong class="calibre7">determining a solution</strong>) based on experience (in this case, the experience might be reviewing example after example).</p>

<div class="packt_figref">A conventional database model representation</div>
<p class="calibre4">As we noted in the previous section of this chapter, neural network models are a <strong class="calibre7">system of processing nodes</strong>, interconnected across layers that do not process data in a sequential manner. How does this scheme compare to a conventional database model or program?</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the technology industry, a conventional (database) model is sometimes called a <strong class="calibre7">serial processing component</strong>, which means that this type of model has a central processing unit or CPU (perhaps you can think of this as a large, central <em class="calibre21">processing node</em>) that accesses raw data and instructions (already stored in memory).</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a conventional database model, the central processor carries out calculations or logic (an algorithm) on input or selected data, stores the calculated results (in a specified memory location), then goes on to the next instruction (and data), and so on—until a solution or result is reached.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This idea is somewhat analogous to the concept of a solitary processing <em class="calibre21">stream</em> within a neural network:</p>
<ul class="calibre18">
<li class="calibre19">A node accepts or consumes data</li>
<li class="calibre19">A node applies logic</li>
<li class="calibre19">A node outputs its results</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre4">Similar, but keep in mind that conventional database models are serial in that they perform each task (or instruction) in a linear, or one after the other, fashion, while multiple node streams within an artificial neural network model perform tasks in parallel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, in a serial system, the computational steps are deterministic, sequential, and logical, and the state of a given variable can be tracked from one operation to another. In comparison, ANNs are not sequential or necessarily deterministic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There are other key differences, which include the following notions which are explained in the following sub-sections.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There are also no separate memory addresses to store data within an artificial neural network model.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instead, information is contained in the overall activation <em class="calibre21">state</em> of the model. <strong class="calibre7">Knowledge</strong> is therefore represented by the artificial neural network model itself, which is quite literally more than the sum of its individual components.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a final point, for the data developer, the notion of an artificial neural network might be imagined as <strong class="calibre7">kicking-off</strong> and running multiple SQL queries asynchronously. Imagine creating a SQL <strong class="calibre7">DTS</strong> (<strong class="calibre7">Data Transformation Services</strong>) or <strong class="calibre7">SQL Server Integration Services</strong> (<strong class="calibre7">SSIS</strong>) package with a simple branching task flow so that DTS will launch tasks in individual <strong class="calibre7">spids</strong> (<strong class="calibre7">Server Process ID</strong>). Each of the spids then would align to the idea of a neural network node stream, all working in parallel to create a result or solution.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A very good explanation of how a neural network works--using a data developer-type practical example—can be found online authored by Sunil Ray.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Understanding and coding Neural Networks from Scratch in Python and R, which, as of writing this, can be found at <span class="calibre5"><a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com" target="_blank" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">www.analyticsvidhya.com</a> under: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-and-r/" target="_blank" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">/blog/2017/05/neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-and-r</a>.</span></div>
<p class="calibre4">He terms the following quote:</p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre21">"If you have been a developer or seen one work you know how it is to search for bugs in a code. You would fire various test cases by varying the inputs or circumstances and look for the output. The change in output provides you a hint on where to look for the bug--which module to check, which lines to read. Once you find it, you make the changes and the exercise continues until you have the right code/application.</em></p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre21">Neural networks work in very similar manner. It takes several input, processes it through multiple neurons from multiple hidden layers and returns the result using an output layer. This result estimation process is technically known as <strong class="calibre7">Forward Propagation</strong>.</em></p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre21">Next, we compare the result with actual output. The task is to make the output to neural network as close to actual (desired) output. Each of these neurons are contributing some error to final output. How do you reduce the error?</em></p>
<p class="calibre4"><em class="calibre21">We try to minimize the value/ weight of neurons those are contributing more to the error and this happens while traveling back to the neurons of the neural network and finding where the error lies. This process is known as <strong class="calibre7">Backward Propagation</strong>."</em></p>
<p class="calibre4">Okay, that was a lot to take in--but now that we, with any luck, have a respectable understanding of what an artificial neural network is and how it works, let's look at ANNs and the R programming language.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yes, you will find that there is plenty of respectable, easy-to-understand, and valuable information and examples on artificial neural networks generously obtainable on the internet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One such resource is offered by Gekko Quant (<a href="http://gekkoquant.com/author/gekkoquant/" target="_blank" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">http://gekkoquant.com/author/gekkoquant/</a>) <span class="calibre14">and is worth taking some time to locate and read.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4">This information offers a very nice tutorial that produces an artificial neural network that takes a single input (a number that you want to calculate a square root for) and produces a single output (the square root of the number input).</p>
<p class="calibre4">The output of this artificial neural network example model is nicely displayed in an easy-to-understand format and I'll show it here as a great example of how the results of an ANN model should look:</p>

<div class="packt_figref">Results of an ANN</div>
<p class="calibre4">From the output information shown here, you can see (as the author declares) that the neural network does a reasonable job at finding the square root (of each input number).</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before a data scientist can begin the process of fitting an artificial neural network, some important time-saving groundwork needs to be accomplished, which we'll discuss in the next few sections.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be sure, artificial neural networks are not easy to understand, train, and tune; some preparatory or preprocessing first is strongly recommended.</p>

            <article class="calibre2">
                
<p class="calibre4">Let's start with the obvious—our data!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The more experience a data scientist gains with working with ANN models, the more he or she will come to understand the importance of formally reviewing and preparing the data ahead of he or she can begin attempting to train or fit the model.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We discussed data cleaning in <a href="01c3daac-ead5-44c1-b17b-d49862f3067d.xhtml" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">Chapter 3</a><em class="calibre21">,  A Developer Approach to Data Cleaning,</em> so you should have a good understanding of the importance of and the process of data cleaning and cleansing at this point, so we'll focus here on some data preparation efforts more specific to our topic of artificial neural network models.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It is a popular opinion among data scientists that it may be good practice to normalize your data before training an artificial neural network on it. Depending on your data, not performing any data normalization may lead to unusable results or at least to a very difficult training process; most of the time, the algorithm will not converge before the number of maximum iterations allowed--in other words, it runs out of attempts!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Based on industry experience, the artificial neural network may have difficulty converging before the maximum number of iterations allowed if the data is not normalized.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although there are numerous and diverse methods to accomplish normalization or normalizing of your data, one of the most universally used is the R built-in <kbd class="calibre22">scale()</kbd> function, which can easily accomplish this task.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scale function is a generic R function whose default method centers and/or scales (normalized) the columns of a numeric matrix for you.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I like the following scale example using simple R code statements because it makes it obvious that the scale function works correctly (as expected?) and is a lot more effective than attempting to perform <em class="calibre21">manual</em> scaling, that is, writing the R code statements to scale the values.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Take a quick look:</p>
<pre class="calibre29">Setting up the sample data, in the object named "x":<br class="calibre2"/># --- set up the data<br class="calibre2"/>Set.seed(1)<br class="calibre2"/>X &lt;- runif(7)<br class="calibre2"/>Next, here is the manual scaling approach, using mean and sd:<br class="calibre2"/>#---manual scale method<br class="calibre2"/>(x - mean(x)) /sd(x)<br class="calibre2"/>And then the use of the R scale function:<br class="calibre2"/># --- scale using the function<br class="calibre2"/>Scale(x)</pre>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, here is the output, showing the same results produced out of both the manual scale approach as well as out of the scale function:</p>

<p class="calibre4">The next step in our preprocessing is <em class="calibre21">splitting the data</em>.

<p class="calibre4">However, recall that the process of data splitting will have the objective of creating both a training subset of data as well as a testing subset of data, from the original dataset or source (based on appropriate logic).</p>
<p class="calibre4">For example, we could accomplish our data split by <em class="calibre21">randomly</em> splitting the data into a train and a test set, then fit a linear regression model and test it on the test dataset (or use the split method we used in the last chapter, to create a 70/30 split of our data).</p>

<p class="calibre4">There is no best practice or recommended rule or policy that will tell the data scientist how many layers and/or nodes to use (although there are several more or less industry--accepted rules) in an artificial neural network model.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Customarily, if at all necessary, one hidden layer is enough for most or, a vast number of, artificial neural network statistical applications (although you may have observed that we showed three hidden layers in our graphical image at the beginning of this chapter).</p>
<p class="calibre4">As far as the number of nodes, the number should frequently be between the input layer size and the output layer size, usually 2/3 of the input size.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Bottom line—when the data scientist is determining the number of layers and nodes to have in his or her artificial neural network model, they will test, test, and test again (and again and again) to find the best or most optimal solution to meet the current requirements, as there is no guarantee that any past experience or <em class="calibre21">rules</em> will fit your statistical model best.</p>

<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre7">Cross-validation</strong> is an important topic that we introduced in <a href="5f479943-b0ab-4276-b173-c571647b1c5c.xhtml" target="_blank" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">Chapter 2</a><em class="calibre21">, Declaring the Objectives</em>, and again we recall that it IS a very important step in building any predictive model.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While there are many different kinds of cross-validation methods, the basic idea is a data scientist repeating the following process a number of times:</p>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre7">Train me, test me, split me</strong>:</p>
<ol class="calibre25">
<li class="calibre27">Do the train-test split.</li>
<li class="calibre27">Fit the model to the train set.</li>

<li class="calibre27">Calculate and review the prediction error.</li>
<li class="calibre27">Repeat (<em class="calibre20">n</em> number of times).</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre4">By conducting the preceding process a number of times, the data scientist will then be able to calculate the average error that is then used to assess how the statistical model is performing (performance is another important topic, one which we discussed in <a href="29276841-ef5a-4a37-bd4b-ff17f364a93a.xhtml" class="pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre1 calibre8 pcalibre2">Chapter 8</a><em class="calibre21">, Database Development and Assessment</em>).</p>

<p class="calibre4">ANNs can be very challenging to comprehend (even for the most advanced or seasoned data scientist). Explaining their outcome (or results) is much more demanding than explaining the outcome of a simpler model such as a linear model.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sometimes, data scientists will understand an artificial neural network model at only a very high level. Although one can have only this level of understanding and still be able to be productive, not fully understanding the interworkings of artificial neural network models can result in a situation referred to as a <strong class="calibre7">BBU</strong> model or <strong class="calibre7">black box understood model</strong> or method.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">A black box model, method, or system is one that can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Consequently, depending on the kind of application you need, you might want to keep in mind that you will have to properly explain the results of the model (not just run the model and producing a result) before the results can be useful, and therefore invest the time in gaining a proper, detailed understanding of the model and methods being used.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The key term in this statement is enough time. Data scientists (and human beings in general) almost never, ever have the luxury of enough time--and time may be the difference between your organization's success and the competition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In defense of using artificial neural networks (rather than a <em class="calibre21">reasonably intelligent</em> human) are some of the following additional advantages of artificial neural network models:</p>
<ul class="calibre18">
<li class="calibre19">Make discoveries no one has even imagined yet</li>
<li class="calibre19">Find solutions in much less time than even a team of people</li>

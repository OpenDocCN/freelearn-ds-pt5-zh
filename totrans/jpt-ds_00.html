<p class="calibre5">Jupyter is an open platform that is growing in use. Jupyter can have programs written in a variety of languages. Many of these languages are geared towards data science, such as R and Python. In this book, we'll look at solving data science problems using a variety of languages on the Jupyter platform.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We will start by looking into some of the basics of Jupyter. Then we will use Jupyter as the platform for our data analysis and visualizations. We'll look into data mining, data wrangling, and machine learning, all under the auspices of the Jupyter framework.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You will learn how to use Jupyter to solve your data science problems using a suite of programming languages.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Similarly, the preceding <kbd class="calibre21">describe</kbd> statement gives us some quick statistics on the data frame."</p>
<p class="calibre5">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="commandlinepackt"><strong class="calibre3">plt.xlabel("Actual Price")<br class="calibre2"/></strong><strong class="calibre3">plt.ylabel("Predicted Price")<br class="calibre2"/></strong><strong class="calibre3">plt.title("Actual Price vs Predicted Price")</strong></pre>
<p class="calibre5"><strong class="calibre7">New terms</strong> and <strong class="calibre7">important words</strong> are shown in bold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "The Running tab lists the notebooks that have been started."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>

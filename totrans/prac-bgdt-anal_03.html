<p>There are several platforms today that are used for large-scale data analytics. At a broad level, these are divided into platforms that are used primarily for data mining, such as analysis of large datasets using NoSQL platforms, and those that are used for data science—that is, machine learning and predictive analytics. Oftentimes, the solution may have both the characteristics—a robust underlying platform for storing and managing data, and solutions that have been built on top of them that provide additional capabilities in data science.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will show you how to install and configure your Analytics Toolkit, a collection of software that we'll use for the rest of the chapters:</p>

<p>This book will utilize several key technologies that are used for big data mining and more generally data science. Our Analytics Toolkit consists of Hadoop and Spark, which can be installed both locally on the user's machine as well as on the cloud; and it has R and Python, both of which can be installed on the user's machine as well as on a cloud platform. Your Analytics Toolkit will consist of:</p>

<p>If you're installing Hadoop on a local machine, it is recommended that your system should have at least 4-8 GB of RAM (memory) and sufficient free disk space of at least 50 GB. Ideally, 8 GB or more memory will suffice for most applications. Below this, the performance will be lower but not prevent the user from carrying out the exercises. Please note that these numbers are estimates that are applicable for the exercises outlined in this book. A production environment will naturally have much higher requirements, which will be discussed at a later stage.</p>
<p>Installing analytics software, especially platforms such as Hadoop, can be quite challenging in terms of technical complexity and it is highly common for users to encounter errors that would have to be painstakingly resolved. Users spend more time attempting to resolve errors and fixing installation issues than they ideally should. This sort of additional overhead can easily be alleviated by using <strong>virtual machines</strong> (<strong>VMs</strong>), or more recently, containers such as Docker. For simpler platforms such as R and Python, we'll be using open source versions that come preinstalled with various libraries.</p>

<p>The exercises in this book can be performed on any Windows, macOS, or Linux machine. The user will need Oracle VirtualBox (which can be installed from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>)  to begin the process of installing the required software for the Analytics Toolkit.</p>

<p><span>An alternative to installing the software on your physical hardware is to use Cloud-based services. Cloud services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure from Microsoft provide an extremely agile and versatile environment to provision servers on demand at a cost of a few cents to a few dollars per hour of usage. While cloud installation is beyond the scope of this book, it is very simple to create a free AWS Account and use the same to install the different pieces of analytics software discussed in this book. Note that if you are using AWS/Azure or any of the other cloud services, you'll need to use the Docker version of Cloudera Hadoop distribution.</span></p>

<p>There are several ways to install Hadoop. The most common ones are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installing Hadoop from the source files from <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org" target="_blank">https://hadoop.apache.org</a></li>
<li>Installing using open source distributions from commercial vendors such as Cloudera and Hortonworks</li>
</ol>
<p>In this exercise, we will install the <strong>Cloudera Distribution of Apache Hadoop</strong> (<strong>CDH</strong>), an integrated platform consisting of several Hadoop and Apache-related products. Cloudera is a popular commercial Hadoop vendor that provides managed services for enterprise-scale Hadoop deployments in addition to its own release of Hadoop. In our case, we'll be installing the HDP Sandbox in a VM environment.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing Oracle VirtualBox</h1>
                </header>

<p>A VM environment is essentially a copy of an existing operating system that may have preinstalled software. The VM can be delivered in a single file, which allows users to replicate an entire machine by just launching a file instead of reinstalling the OS and configuring it to mimic another system. The VM operates in a self-contained environment; that is, it does not depend on the host operating system to deliver its functionalities.</p>
<p>To install CDH Quickstart VM, we will be using Oracle VirtualBox, which is used to launch VMs from VM files.</p>
<p>Steps to install CDH in VirtualBox:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Oracle VirtualBox relevant for your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</span></a> (if this link is not accessible, go to <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.virtualbox.org/</span></a> and select the appropriate link to go to the <strong>Downloads</strong> page).</li>
<li>Double-click on the Oracle VirtualBox executable and install by following the prompts on the screen (you can accept the defaults as will be shown on screen).</li>
<li>After you have installed VirtualBox, you should also install the <strong>Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack</strong> available at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html#extpack" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html#extpack</span></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Download the Extension Pack file relevant to your environment and click/double-click on the file. This will open the Oracle VM VirtualBox application and install the Extension Pack within the VirtualBox environment.</p>
<p><strong>Downloading and installing the CDH Quickstart VM</strong>: The Quickstart VM or Docker Image for CDH can be downloaded from the Cloudera website. The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.cloudera.com" target="_blank">https://www.cloudera.com</a> and click on Quickstart VMs from the <strong>Download</strong> menu at the top of the page. If the navigation has been changed, a search on Google for Cloudera Quickstart VM will usually take you directly to the Cloudera download page:</li>

<p><span>R is a statistical language that has become extremely popular over the last 3-5 years, especially as a platform that can be used for a wide variety of use cases, ranging from simple data mining to complex machine learning algorithms. According to an article posted in IEEE Spectrum in mid-2016, R takes the No. 5 spot among the Top 10 languages in the world.</span></p>
<p>Open source R can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.r-project.org" target="_blank">https://www.r-project.org</a> via the CRAN site located at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html" target="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>.</p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can download R from the Microsoft R Open page at <a href="https://mran.microsoft.com/rro/" target="_blank">https://mran.microsoft.com/rro/</a>. This was earlier known as Revolution R Open, an enhanced version of open source R released by Revolution Analytics. After Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics in 2015, it was rebranded under the new ownership.</span></p>
<p>Microsoft R Open includes all the functionalities of R, but also includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerous R packages installed by default as well as a set of specialized packages released by Microsoft Corporation that complements the existing features of open source R</li>
<li>Multi-threaded Math Libraries for multi-threaded computations in R</li>
<li>A fixed CRAN Repository called MRAN. CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network is a collection of sites that contains R binaries, packages, and associated content. Packages on CRAN can be updated on a continuous basis. MRAN takes a fixed snapshot of CRAN, which remains the same until the next release, thus allowing reproducibility and consistency.</li>

<p>We proceed with the installation as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Similar to R, Python has gained popularity due to its versatile and diverse range of packages. Python is generally available as part of most modern Linux-based operating systems. For our exercises, we will use Anaconda from Continuum Analytics®, which enhances the base open source Python offering with many data-mining- and machine-learning-related packages that are installed natively as part of the platform. This alleviates the need for the practitioner to manually download and install packages. In that sense, it is conceptually similar in spirit to Microsoft R Open. Just as Microsoft R enhances the base open source R offering with additional functionality, Anaconda improves upon the offerings of base open source Python to provide new capabilities.</li>

<p>This concludes the process of installing Hadoop (CDH), Spark, R, and Python. In later chapters, we will investigate these platforms in further detail.</p>

<p>This chapter introduced some of the key tools used for data science. In particular, it demonstrated how to download and install the virtual machine for the Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop (CDH), Spark, R, RStudio, and Python. Although the user can download the source code of Hadoop and install it on, say, a Unix system, it is usually fraught with issues and requires a fair amount of debugging. Using a VM instead allows the user to begin using and learning Hadoop with minimal effort as it is a complete preconfigured environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, R and Python are the two most commonly used languages for machine learning and in general, analytics. They are available for all popular operating systems. Although they can be installed in the VM, the user is encouraged to try and install them on their local machines (laptop/workstation) if feasible as it will have relatively higher performance.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into the details of Hadoop and its core components and concepts.</p>

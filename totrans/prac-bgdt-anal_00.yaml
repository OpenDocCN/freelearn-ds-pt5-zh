- en: This book introduces the reader to a broad spectrum of topics related to big
    data as used in the enterprise. Big data is a vast area that encompasses elements
    of technology, statistics, visualization, business intelligence, and many other
    related disciplines. To get true value from data that oftentimes remains inaccessible,
    either due to volume or technical limitations, companies must leverage proper
    tools both at the software as well as the hardware level.

- en: To that end, the book not only covers the theoretical and practical aspects
    of big data, but also supplements the information with high-level topics such
    as the use of big data in the enterprise, big data and data science initiatives
    and key considerations such as resources, hardware/software stack and other related
    topics. Such discussions would be useful for IT departments in organizations that
    are planning to implement or upgrade the organizational big data and/or data science
    platform.

- en: Big data is ubiquitous today, just as the term *data warehouse*Â was omnipresent
    not too long ago. There are a myriad of solutions in the industry. In particular,
    Hadoop and products in the Hadoop ecosystem have become both popular and increasingly
    common in the enterprise. Further, more recent innovations such as Apache Spark
    have also found a permanent presence in the enterprise - Hadoop clients, realizing
    that they may not need the complexity of the Hadoop framework have shifted to
    Spark in large numbers. Finally, NoSQL solutions, such as MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra
    and commercial solutions such as Teradata, Vertica and kdb+ have provided have
    taken the place of more conventional database systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will cover these areas with a fair degree of depth. Hadoop and related
    products such as Hive, HBase, Pig Latin and others have been covered. We have
    also covered Spark and explained key concepts in Spark such as Actions and Transformations.
    NoSQL solutions such as MongoDB and KDB+ have also been covered to a fair extent
    and hands-on tutorials have also been provided.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second topic that has been covered is machine learning, also known by various
    other names, such as Predictive Analytics, Statistical Learning and others. Detailed
    explanations with corresponding machine learning code written using R and machine
    learning packages in R have been provided. Algorithms, such as random forest,
    support vector machines, neural networks, stochastic gradient boosting, decision
    trees have been discussed. Further, key concepts in machine learning such as bias
    and variance, regularization, feature section, data pre-processing have also been
    covered.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, books that cover theoretical topics seldom discuss the more high-level
    aspects of big data - such as the key requirements for a successful big data initiative.
    The book includes survey results from IT executives and highlights the shared
    needs that are common across the industry. The book also includes a step-by-step
    guide on how to select the right use cases, whether it is for big data or for
    machine learning based on lessons learned from deploying production solutions
    in large IT departments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We believe that with a strong foundational knowledge of these three areas, any
    practitioner can deliver successful big data and/or data science projects. That
    is the primary intention behind the overall structure and content of the book.

- en: '**Technical audience**: For technically minded readers, the book contains detailed
    explanations of the key industry tools for big data and machine learning. Hands-on
    exercises using Hadoop, developing machine learning use cases using the R programming
    language, building comprehensive production-grade dashboards with R Shiny have
    been covered. Other tutorials in Spark and NoSQL have also been included. Besides
    the practical aspects, the theoretical underpinnings of these key technologies
    have also been explained.'

<p class="mce-root">Data science is a discipline at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and data mining with the objective of gaining new knowledge from existing data by means of algorithmic and statistical analysis. In this book, you will learn the seven most important ways in data science of analyzing the data. Each chapter first explains its algorithm or analysis as a simple concept, supported by a trivial example. Further examples and exercises are used to build and expand your knowledge of a particular type of analysis.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This book is for aspiring data science professionals who are familiar with Python and have a background of sorts in statistics. Developers who are currently implementing one or two data science algorithms and who now want to learn more to expand their skillset will find this book quite useful.</p>

<p class="mce-root">To get the most out of this book, you require, first and foremost, an active attitude to think of the problems—a lot of new content is presented in the exercises at the end of the chapter in the section entitled <em class="calibre18">Problems</em>. You also then need to be able to run Python programs on the operating system of your choice. The author ran the programs on the Linux operating system using the command line</p>

<p>Nowadays, one of the big buzzwords in computing is <em>cloud</em>. The simplest example is that for many users, Google Drive is a kind of cloud where users can save their files, photos, and programs and share them with their colleagues, family members, or others. Another example is so-called cloud computing. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (for example, networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. In Old English, <em>mass of rock, hill</em>, was related to cloud. The <em>metaphoric extension to raincloud, mass of evaporated water in the sky,</em> was attested by c. 1200, based on the similarity of cumulus clouds and rock masses. The usual <em>Old English</em> word for cloud was <em>weolcan.</em> In Middle English, <em>skie</em> also originally meant cloud. In this chapter, the following topics will be covered:</p>

<p>Nowadays, we have used or at least heard of the word cloud. Usually, it means that we can save our data on other people's servers. For Anaconda Cloud, users can use the platform to save and share packages, notebooks, projects, and environments. The process, platform, and the methodology make it much easier for package management and collaboration, including sharing of their packages and projects. The public projects and notebooks are free. At the moment, private plans start at $7 per month. Anaconda Cloud allows users to create or distribute software packages.</p>
<p>For a Windows version of Anaconda, click <span class="packt_screen">All Programs </span>| <span class="packt_screen">Anaconda</span>, and then choose <span class="packt_screen">Anaconda Cloud</span>.</p>
<p>After double-clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Cloud</span>, the welcome screen will appear.</p>
<p>Based on the information presented by the welcome screen, we know that we need an account with Anaconda before we can use it. After login, we will see the following screen:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954 image-border" src="Images/c2dc6afe-4a30-4e5f-8d9e-e319862238bf.png" style="width:43.17em;height:26.75em;" width="968" height="599"/></div>
<p>For example, if you double-click on <span class="packt_screen">Installing your first package</span>, you will get more information on <strong>Anaconda Cloud</strong>. We do not need to be logged in, or even need a cloud account, to search for public packages, download, and install them. We need an account only to access private packages without a token or to share your packages with others.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Jupyter Notebook in depth</h1>
                </header>

<p>In this section, many examples are borrowed from the following web page: <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth">https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth</a>. If you are interested, you can explore more by going to the web page in order to download a ZIP file. The following screenshot shows the content of examples:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-955 image-border" src="Images/d56f9156-4b65-4449-b6f2-0c45eacbe337.png" style="width:32.42em;height:18.33em;" width="500" height="282"/></div>
<p>After launching Jupyter Notebook, we can search the <kbd>example</kbd> subdirectory. For example, we can upload a notebook called <kbd>factoring.ipynb</kbd> under the <kbd>Interactive Widgets</kbd> <span>subdirectory</span>(see the following screenshot):  </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956 image-border" src="Images/461e8e0d-e1d9-4757-b02e-950e2e931341.png" style="width:34.00em;height:26.67em;" width="577" height="452"/></div>
<p>After clicking <span class="packt_screen">Run</span>, we can change the value of <kbd>n</kbd> (see the following result when we choose <kbd>8</kbd> for the variable):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-957 image-border" src="Images/adf6f6c8-2960-4309-9593-d507f645ccaf.png" style="width:18.92em;height:5.67em;" width="371" height="111"/></div>
<p>After increasing <kbd>n</kbd> to <kbd>20,</kbd> we have the corresponding output:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-958 image-border" src="Images/7ac714b8-fc67-4c93-938a-01050c91643e.png" style="width:43.75em;height:5.75em;" width="803" height="105"/></div>
<p>Sometimes, after running a Jupyter Notebook and logging out, we need a token or password to login again. We can run the following code to locate our token:</p>
<pre><strong>Jupyter notebook list</strong> </pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can run the following code to save our token to a text file:</p>
<pre><strong>Jupyter notebook list &gt; t.txt</strong> </pre>
<p>The next example shows how to activate Jupyter QtConsole, that is, how to connect to an existing IPython kernel using the QtConsole. Again, the Jupyter Notebook is also included in the preceding download. First, we upload the notebook called <kbd>Connecting with the Qt Console.ipynb</kbd>. To save space, only the first several lines are shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959 image-border" src="Images/29e5a190-d273-4206-8f1d-9b607bd39e57.png" style="width:23.67em;height:14.17em;" width="434" height="258"/></div>
<p>After the program runs without any issues, we will see the following window:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960 image-border" src="Images/d64e7096-d537-48c8-a571-cfca8564df7b.png" style="width:36.00em;height:10.00em;" width="520" height="145"/></div>
<div>
<p>Then, we type our commands here. The <strong>QtConsole</strong> is a lightweight application that feels like a Terminal. However, it provides a number of enhancements only possible in a GUI, such as inline figures, proper multi-line editing with syntax highlighting, and graphical calltips. The QtConsole can use any Jupyter kernel. Here is one example:</p>
</div>
<pre><span>import numpy as np </span><br/>from scipy.special import jn 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from matplotlib.pyplot import plot 
# 
x=np.linspace(0,3*np.pi) 
for i in range(6): 
    plot(x,jn(i,x)) 
# 
plt.show() </pre>
<p>The associated diagram is shown here:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Formats of Jupyter Notebook</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we discuss the backbone of issues related to Jupyter Notebook's formats.</p>
<p>For more information associated with the formats for Jupyter Notebook, you will find a useful link here: <a href="https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>. First, let's look at one of the simplest notebooks, <kbd>Custom Widget –<em> </em>Spreadsheet.ipynb</kbd>. It has just five lines, shown here:</p>
<pre>{ 
 "cells": [], 
 "metadata": {}, 
 "nbformat": 4, 
 "nbformat_minor": 0 
} </pre>
<p><span>The whole notebook code is included in a pair of curly brackets. At the highest level, a Jupyter notebook is a dictionary with the following few keys:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>metadata</kbd> (<kbd>dict</kbd>)</li>
<li><kbd>nbformat</kbd> (<kbd>int</kbd>)</li>
<li><kbd>nbformat_minor</kbd> (<kbd>int</kbd>)</li>
<li><kbd>cells</kbd> (<kbd>list</kbd>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous example code block, both the cells and metadata are empty. The notebook format has a value of <kbd>4</kbd>. It is always a good idea that we ourselves generate a simple program. Save it as a Jupyter notebook. Then we can look at its structure. Next, let's generate a simple Python program via Jupyter Notebook (see the following three lines):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-962 image-border" src="Images/670961c4-e66a-42f6-b982-3c0507a7acd3.png" style="width:31.67em;height:13.42em;" width="473" height="200"/></div>
<p>To download this program, just click <span class="packt_screen">File </span>| <span class="packt_screen">Download As</span> and choose <span class="packt_screen">Notebook (.ipynb)</span> as the format. Here is the related code for the preceding three lines. Its name is <kbd>c11_01simplePython.ipynb</kbd>:</p>
<pre>{ 
 "cells": [ 
  { 
   "cell_type": "code", 
   "execution_count": null, 
   "metadata": { 
    "collapsed": true 
   }, 
   "outputs": [], 
   "source": [ 
    "# import numpy as npn", 
    "x=10n", 
    "print(np.sqrt(x))" 
   ] 
  } 
 ], 
 "metadata": { 
  "kernelspec": { 
   "display_name": "Python 3", 
   "language": "python", 
   "name": "python3" 
  }, 
  "language_info": { 
   "codemirror_mode": { 
    "name": "ipython", 
    "version": 3 
   }, 
   "file_extension": ".py", 
   "mimetype": "text/x-python", 
   "name": "python", 
   "nbconvert_exporter": "python", 
   "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", 
   "version": "3.6.3" 
  } 
 }, 
 "nbformat": 4, 
 "nbformat_minor": 2 
} </pre>

<p>To share a notebook or project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save your notebook.</li>
<li>Log in by running the Anaconda login command.</li>
<li>To upload your notebook to the cloud, open the Anaconda prompt or Terminal and enter the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>anaconda upload my-notebook.ipynb</strong> </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>To check, we can try the link at <a href="http://notebooks.anaconda.org/%3cUSERNAME%3e/my-notebook">http://notebooks.anaconda.org/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/my-notebook</a>, where <span class="packt_screen">USERNAME</span> would be your username.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing of projects</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>First, let's look at the definition of a project. A project is a folder that contains an <kbd>anaconda-project.yml</kbd> configuration file together with scripts (code), notebooks, datasets, and other files. We can add a folder into a project by adding a configuration file named <kbd>anaconda-project.yml</kbd> to the folder. The configuration file can include the following sections: commands, variables, services, downloads, packages, channels, and environment specifications. Data scientists can use projects to encapsulate data science projects and make them easily portable. A project is usually compressed into a <kbd>.tar.bz2</kbd> file for sharing and storing.</p>
<p><strong>Anaconda Project</strong> automates setup steps, so that people with whom you share projects can run your projects with the following single command:</p>
<pre><strong>anaconda-project run</strong> </pre>
<p>To install Anaconda Project, type the following:</p>
<pre><strong>conda install anaconda-project</strong> </pre>
<p>Anaconda Project encapsulates data science projects and makes them easily portable. It automates setup steps such as installing the right packages, downloading files, setting environment variables, and running commands. Project makes it easy to reproduce your work, share projects with others, and run them on different platforms. It also simplifies deployment to servers. Anaconda projects run the same way on your machine, on another user's machine, or when deployed to a server.</p>
<p>Traditional build scripts such as <kbd>setup.py</kbd> automate building of the project – going from source code to something runnable – while Project automates running the project, taking build artifacts, and doing any necessary setup before executing them.</p>
<p>We can use Project on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Project is supported and offered by Anaconda Inc® and contributors under a three-clause BSD license. Project sharing will save us a great deal of time, since other developers will not spend too much time on the work done already. Here is the procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build up your project</li>
<li>Log in to Anaconda</li>
<li>From the project's directory on your computer, type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>anaconda-project upload</strong> </pre>
<p>Alternatively, from Anaconda Navigator, in the <span class="packt_screen">Projects</span> tab, upload via the bottom-right <span class="packt_screen">Upload to Anaconda Cloud</span>.</p>
<p>Projects can be any directory of code and assets. Often, projects will contain notebooks or Bokeh applications, for example. Here, we show how to generate a project called <kbd>project01</kbd>. First, we want to move to the correct location. Assume that we choose <kbd>c:/temp/</kbd>. The key command is given here:</p>
<pre><strong>anaconda-project init --directory project01</strong> </pre>
<p>Next, both commands are shown side by side as well:</p>
<pre><strong>$ cd c:/temp/ 
$ anaconda-project init --directory project01 
Create directory 'c:tempproject01'? y 
Project configuration is in c:tempproject01iris/anaconda-project.yml</strong> </pre>
<p>The corresponding output is shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-966 image-border" src="Images/0d31d7d9-9772-47e8-a686-1c5f16268d3e.png" style="width:34.67em;height:4.75em;" width="528" height="72"/></div>
<p>We can also turn any existing directory into a project by switching to the directory and then running <kbd>anaconda-project init</kbd> without options or arguments. We can use MS Word to open <kbd>anaconda-project.yml</kbd> (see the first couple of lines shown here):</p>
<pre># This is an Anaconda project file. 
# 
# Here you can describe your project and how to run it. 
# Use `anaconda-project run` to run the project. 
# The file is in YAML format, please see http://www.yaml.org/start.html for more. 
# 
# Set the 'name' key to name your project 
# 
name: project01 
# 
# Set the 'icon' key to give your project an icon 
# 
icon: 
# 
# Set a one-sentence-or-so 'description' key with project details 
# 
description: 
# 
# In the commands section, list your runnable scripts, notebooks, and other code. 
# Use `anaconda-project add-command` to add commands. 
# </pre>
<p>There are two ways to share our projects with others. First, we archive the project by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>anaconda-project archive project01.zip</strong> </pre>
<p>Then, we email the ZIP file to our colleague or others. The second way of sharing a project is to use Anaconda Cloud. Log in to Anaconda Cloud first. From the project's directory on our computer, type <kbd>anaconda-project upload</kbd>, or, from Anaconda Navigator, in the <span class="packt_screen">Projects</span> tab, upload via the bottom-right <span class="packt_screen">Upload to Anaconda Cloud</span>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In terms of computer software, an operating environment or integrated applications environment is the environment in which users can execute software. Usually, such an environment consists of a user interface and an API. To a certain degree, the term <em>platform</em> could be viewed as its synonym. There are many reasons why we want to share our environment with someone else. For example, they can re-create a test that we have done. To allow them to quickly reproduce our environment with all of its packages and versions, give them a copy of your <kbd>environment.yml</kbd> file. Depending on the operating system, we have the following methods to export our environment file. Note that if we already have an <kbd>environment.yml</kbd> file in our current directory, it will be overwritten during this task.</p>
<p>There are different ways to activate the <kbd>myenv</kbd> environment file depending on the systems used. For Windows users, in our Anaconda prompt, type the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>activate myenv</strong> </pre>
<p>On macOS and Linux, in our Terminal window, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>source activate myenv</strong> </pre>
<p>Note that we replace <kbd>myenv</kbd> with the name of the environment. To export our active environment to a new file, type the following:</p>
<pre><strong>conda env export &gt; environment.yml</strong> </pre>
<p>To share, we can simply email or copy the exported <kbd>environment.yml</kbd> file to the other person. On the other hand, in order to remove an environment, run the following code in our Terminal window or at an Anaconda prompt:</p>
<pre><strong>conda remove --name myenv --all</strong> </pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can specify the name, as shown here:</p>
<pre><strong>conda env remove --name myenv</strong> </pre>
<p>To verify that the environment was removed, run the following command line:</p>
<pre><strong>conda info --envs</strong> </pre>

<p>First, we can export our Anaconda environment by using the following command:</p>

<p>Sometimes, users might generate their own packages and upload them to Anaconda Cloud. For a group project, group members can do so as well. Thus, we need to know how to download a package from Anaconda Cloud. Here is the general procedure:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">Assume that we are interested in the <span class="packt_screen">r-data.table</span> package.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Issue the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>conda install -c r-data.table</strong> </pre>
<p>Sometimes, we can generate a set of functions and share with others. Here is one simple example. Assume that we generate the following program with several functions:</p>
<pre>def pv_f(r,n,fv): 
    """ 
    Objective: estimate present value 
           r : period rate 
           n : number of periods 
          fv : future value 
                           fv 
    formula used : pv = --------       
                        (1+r)**n 
    Example 1: &gt;&gt;&gt;pv_f(0.1,1,100)   # meanings of input variables  
                 90.9090909090909   # based on their input order 
    Example #2 &gt;&gt;&gt;pv_f(r=0.1,fv=100,n=1) # on keywords 
                 90.9090909090909 
    """ 
    return fv/(1+r)**n 
# 
def pvGrowingPerpetuity(c,r,q): 
    return(c/(r-q)) 
# 
def fv_f(pv,r,n): 
    return pv*(1+r)**n 
def fvAnnuity(r,n,c): 
    return c/r*((1+r)**n-1) 
# 
def fvAnnuityDue(r,n,c): 
    return c/r*((1+r)**n-1)*(1+r) </pre>
<p>To save space, there is help for only the first function. Assume the preceding function is called <kbd>myfincal.py</kbd> and is located under <kbd>c:/temp</kbd>. We can use the following command to generate a <kbd>myfincal.pyc</kbd> and import <kbd>py_compile</kbd>.</p>
<pre><strong>py_compile.compile('c:/temp/myfincal.py')</strong> </pre>
<p>We have generated a set of functions contained in <kbd>fincal.pyc</kbd>. If you are interested, you can use the following procedure to download and import it:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Download it at <a href="http://canisius.edu/~yany/python/fincal.pyc">http://canisius.edu/~yany/python/fincal.pyc</a>.</li>
<li>Launch Python and try to import it. There are several ways to make <kbd>fincal.pyc</kbd> accessible:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Method 1</strong><span>: Assume that the file is saved under</span> <kbd>c:/temp/</kbd><span>. Change the path, as in the right-hand side of this screenshot: </span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Method 2</strong><span>: Copy </span><kbd>fincal.pyc</kbd><span> to one of the accessible subdirectories. To see all paths, issue the following code:</span></li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 150px">import sys 
sys.path </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 150px">The output is shown here. Different users will have different output:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-969 image-border" src="Images/4784b9b5-b81c-46de-9b73-c4432b468f10.png" style="width:52.42em;height:19.25em;" width="1099" height="403"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 150px">Now, you simply copy <kbd>fincal.pyc</kbd> to one of the preceding subdirectories.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Method 3</strong>: Add the path instead, see the code here:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 150px">import sys 
sys.path.append('c:\temp') </pre>
<p>We can issue <kbd>sys.path</kbd> to check, see the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970 image-border" src="Images/f795574f-cf70-4ab5-8d4e-217d1b345dc1.png" style="width:56.50em;height:19.92em;" width="1111" height="391"/></div>
<p>Note that if we want to remove a path, we can use the following code:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px">import sys 
sys.path.remove('c:\temp') </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now, we could import that module, see the following code:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px">import fincal 
x=dir(fincal) 
print(x) </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The related output is shown here:</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">In this chapter, we have discussed Anaconda Cloud. Some topics included the Jupyter Notebook in depth, different formats of the Jupyter Notebook, how to share notebooks with your partner, how to share different projects over different platforms, how to share your working environments, and how to replicate others' environments locally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">For the next chapter, we will discuss distributed computing and Anaconda Accelerate. When our data or tasks become more complex, we'll need a good system or a set of tools to process data and run a complex algorithm. For this purpose, distributed computing is one solution. In particular, we will explain many concepts, such as compute nodes, project add-ons, parallel processing advanced Python for data parallelism. In addition, we will give several examples showing how to use distributed computing.</p>

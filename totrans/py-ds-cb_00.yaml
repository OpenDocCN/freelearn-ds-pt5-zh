- en: Today, we live in a world of connected things where tons of data is generated
    and it is humanly impossible to analyze all the incoming data and make decisions.
    Human decisions are increasingly replaced by decisions made by computers. Thanks
    to the field of data science. Data science has penetrated deeply in our connected
    world and there is a growing demand in the market for people who not only understand
    data science algorithms thoroughly, but are also capable of programming these
    algorithms. Data science is a field that is at the intersection of many fields,
    including data mining, machine learning, and statistics, to name a few. This puts
    an immense burden on all levels of data scientists; from the one who is aspiring
    to become a data scientist and those who are currently practitioners in this field.
    Treating these algorithms as a black box and using them in decision-making systems
    will lead to counterproductive results. With tons of algorithms and innumerable
    problems out there, it requires a good grasp of the underlying algorithms in order
    to choose the best one for any given problem.

    the number one choice for a data scientist. Its ability to act as a scripting
    language for quick prototype building and its sophisticated language constructs
    for full-fledged software development combined with its fantastic library support
    for numeric computations has led to its current popularity among data scientists
    and the general scientific programming community. Not just that, Python is also
    popular among web developers; thanks to frameworks such as Django and Flask.

- en: This book has been carefully written to cater to the needs of a diverse range
    of data scientists—starting from novice data scientists to experienced ones—through
    carefully crafted recipes, which touch upon the different aspects of data science,
    including data exploration, data analysis and mining, machine learning, and large
    scale machine learning. Each chapter has been carefully crafted with recipes exploring
    these aspects. Sufficient math has been provided for the readers to understand
    the functioning of the algorithms in depth. Wherever necessary, enough references
    are provided for the curious readers. The recipes are written in such a way that
    they are easy to follow and understand.

    readers and helps them master the concepts of data science. Knowledge of Python
    is not mandatory to follow this book. Non-Python programmers can refer to the
    first chapter, which introduces the Python data structures and function programming
    concepts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The early chapters cover the basics of data science and the later chapters are
    dedicated to advanced data science algorithms. State-of-the-art algorithms that
    are currently used in practice by leading data scientists across industries including
    the ensemble methods, random forest, regression with regularization, and others
    are covered in detail. Some of the algorithms that are popular in academia and
    still not widely introduced to the mainstream such as rotational forest are covered
    in detail.

- en: With a lot of do-it-yourself books on data science today in the market, we feel
    that there is a gap in terms of covering the right mix of math philosophy behind
    the data science algorithms and implementation details. This book is an attempt
    to fill this gap. With each recipe, just enough math introductions are provided
    to contemplate how the algorithm works; I believe that the readers can take full
    benefits of these methods in their applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A word of caution though is that these recipes are written with the objective
    of explaining the data science algorithms to the reader. They have not been hard-tested
    in extreme conditions in order to be production ready. Production-ready data science
    code has to go through a rigorous engineering pipeline.

    references. It is a self-contained book to introduce data science to a new reader
    with little programming background and help them become experts in this trade.

    and practitioners from novice to experts. Different recipes in the chapters cater
    to the needs of different audiences. Novice readers can spend some time in getting
    themselves acquainted with data science in the first five chapters. Experts can
    refer to the later chapters to refer/understand how advanced techniques are implemented
    using Python. The book covers just enough mathematics and provides the necessary
    references for computer programmers who wish to understand data science. People
    from a non-Python background can effectively use this book. The first chapter
    of the book introduces Python as a programming language for data science. It will
    be helpful if you have some prior basic programming experience. The book is mostly
    self-contained and introduces data science to a new reader and can help him become
    an expert in this trade.

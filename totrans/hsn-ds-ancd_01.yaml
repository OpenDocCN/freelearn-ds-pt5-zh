    looking for tools in the area of data science. Existing data analysts and data
    science professionals who wish to improve the efficiency of their data science
    applications by using the best libraries with multiple languages will find this
    book quite useful. The platform discussed in detail across various chapters is
    **Anaconda** and the computational tools could be **Python**, **R**, **Julia**,
    or **Octave**. The beauty of using these programming languages is that they are
    all open source, as in free to download. In this chapter, we start from the very
    beginning: a simple introduction. For this book, we assume that readers have some
    basic knowledge related to several programming languages, such as R and Python.
    There are many books available, such as *Python for Data Analysis* by McKinney
    (2013) and *Python for Finance* by Yan (2017).'

    and Khan (2017), or Fang and Zhang (2016)—the catchphrase being big data. However,
    defining it is still controversial, since many explanations are available. Davenport
    and Patil (2012) suggest that if your organization stores multiple petabytes of
    data, if the information most critical to your business resides in forms other
    than rows and columns of numbers, or if answering your biggest question would
    involve a mashup of several analytical efforts, you've got a big data opportunity.

- en: Many users of data science or data analytics are learning several programming
    languages such as R and Python, but how can they use both of them at the same
    time? If John is using R while his teammate is using Python, how do they communicate
    with each other? How do team members share their packages, programs, and even
    their working environments? In this book, we try our best to offer a solution
    to all of these challenging tasks by introducing Anaconda, since it possesses
    several wonderful properties.

    and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for statistical computing.
    *Python* is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language similar to Perl
    that has gained popularity because of its clear syntax and readability. *Julia*
    is for numerical computing and extensive mathematical function and is designed
    for parallelism and cloud computing, while *Octave* is for numerical computation
    and mathematics-oriented and batch-oriented language. All those four languages,
    R, Python, Julia, and Octave, are free.

    each developer, researcher, or team member, might have his/her favorite programming
    language, such as Python, R, Octave, or Julia. If we could have a platform to
    run all of those languages, it would be great. Fortunately, Jupyter is such a
    platform, since this platform can accommodate over 40 languages, including Python,
    R, Julia, Octave, and Scala.

    are other benefits of using Anaconda: we might worry less about the dependency
    of installed packages, manage packages more efficiently, and share our programs,
    projects, and working environments. In addition, Jupyter Notebooks can be shared
    with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub, and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer.'

- en: Anaconda is a full distribution of Python and comes with over 1,000 open source
    packages after installation. Because of this, the total size is over 3 GB. Anaconda
    is good if we intend to have many packages downloaded and pre-installed. On the
    other hand, Miniconda contains only Python and other necessary libraries needed
    to run conda itself. The size for the Miniconda is about 400 MB, much smaller
    than the full version of Anaconda, so extra packages have to be downloaded and
    installed as requested.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing and Converting Jupyter Notebooks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have developed your Notebook, you will want to share it with others. There is a typical mechanism available for sharing that we will cover in this chapter—placing your Notebook on an accessible server on the internet.</p>
<p>When you provide a Notebook to another person, they may need the Notebook in a different format, given their system requirements. We will also cover some mechanisms available for providing your Notebook to others in a different format.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li> Sharing Notebooks</li>
<li> Converting Notebooks</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing Notebooks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The typical mechanism for sharing Notebooks is to provide your Notebook on a website. A website is running on a server or allocated machine space. The server takes care of all the book-keeping involved in running a website, such as keeping track of multiple users and logging people on and off.</p>
<p>In order for the Notebook to be of use though, the website must have Notebook logic installed. A typical website knows how to deliver content as HTML given some source files. The most basic form is pure HTML, where every page you access on the website corresponds exactly to one HTML file on the web server. Other languages could be used to develop the website (such as Java or PHP), so then the server needs to know how to access the HTML it needs from those source files. In our context, the server needs to know how to access your Notebook in order to deliver HTML to users.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Even when Notebooks are just running on your local machine, they are running in a browser that is accessing your local machine (server) instead of the internet—so the web, HTML, and internet access have already been provided.</p>
<p>If a Notebook is on a genuine website, it is available to everyone who can access that website—irrespective of whether the server is running on your machine in an office environment accessible over the local area network, or it is available to all users over the internet.</p>
<p>You can always add security around the website so that the only people who can use your Notebook are those given access by you. Security mechanisms depend on the type of web server software involved.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing Notebooks on a Notebook server</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Built into the Jupyter process is the ability to expose a Notebook as its own web server. Assuming the server is a machine accessible by other users, you can configure Jupyter to run on that server. You must provide the configuration information to Jupyter so that it knows how to proceed. The command to generate a configuration file for your Jupyter installation is shown in the following example:</p>
<p>Note that, as we are running in Anaconda, I am running the command from that directory:</p>
<pre><strong>C:\Users\Dan\Anaconda3\Scripts&gt;jupyter notebook --generate-config</strong></pre>
<p>The default <kbd>config</kbd> is written to: <kbd>C:\Users\Dan\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py</kbd>.</p>
<p>This command will generate a <kbd>jupyter_notebook_config.py</kbd> file in your <kbd>~./jupyter</kbd> directory. For Microsoft users, that directory is a subdirectory of your home user directory.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The configuration file contains the settings that you can use to expose your Notebook as a server:</p>
<pre>c.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/path/to/your/cert/cert.pem'<br/>c.NotebookApp.keyfile = u'/ path/to/your/cert/key.key'<br/>c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'<br/>c.NotebookApp.password = u'hashed-password'<br/>c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False<br/>c.NotebookApp.port = 8888</pre>
<p>The settings in the file are explained in the following table:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">

<p>Every website is addressed at the lower levels by an IP address. An IP address is a four-part number that identifies the locale of the server involved. An IP address might look like <kbd>172.32.88.7</kbd>.<br/>
Web browsers, in concert with internet software, know how to use the IP address to locate the server of interest. The set of software also knows how to translate the URL you mentioned in your browser, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com</a>, into an IP address.</p>
<p>Once you have changed the settings appropriately, you should be able to point a browser at the URL configured and access your Notebook. The URL would be the concatenation of either HTTP or HTTPS (depending on whether you applied an SSL certificate), the IP address, and the port, for example, <kbd>HTTPS://123.45.56.9:8888</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing encrypted Notebooks on a Notebook server</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Two of the settings shown earlier can be used if you have an SSL certificate to apply. Without the SSL certificate, the password (seen previously) and all other interactions will be transmitted from the user's browser to the server in clear text. If you are dealing with sensitive information in your Notebook, you should obtain an SSL certificate and make the appropriate setting changes for your server.</p>
<p>If you need more security regarding access to your Notebook, the next step would be to provide an SSL certificate (placed on your machine, with the path provided in the configuration file). There are a number of companies that provide SSL certificates. The cheapest, at the time of writing, is <em>Let's encrypt</em>, which will provide a low-level SSL certificate for free. (There are gradations of SSL certificates that are not free.)</p>
<p>Again, once you have set the preceding settings with regard to your certificate, you should be able to access your Notebook server using the <kbd>HTTPS://</kbd> prefix, knowing that all the transmissions between the user's browser and the Notebook server are encrypted and therefore secure.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing Notebooks on a web server</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In order to add your Notebook to an existing web server, you need to take the preceding steps and add a little more information to the Notebook configuration file, as in the following example:</p>
<pre>c.NotebookApp.tornado_settings = {<br/>'headers': {<br/>'Content-Security-Policy': "frame-ancestors 'https://yourwebsite.com' 'self' "<br/>}<br/>}</pre>
<p>Here, you replace <kbd>yourwebsite.com</kbd> with the URL of your website.</p>
<p>Once complete, you can access the Notebook through your website.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing Notebooks through Docker</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Docker is an open, lightweight container for distributing software. A typical Docker instance has an entire web server and a specific web application running on a port in a machine. The specifics about the software running in a Docker instance are governed by the Dockerfile. This file provides commands to the Docker environment as to which components to use to configure this instance. A sample Dockerfile for a Jupyter implementation would look like this:</p>
<pre>ENV TINI_VERSION v0.6.0
ADD https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini /usr/bin/tini<br/>RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/tini<br/>ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/tini", "--"]<br/>EXPOSE 8888<br/>CMD ["jupyter", "Notebook", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--ip=0.0.0.0"]</pre>
<p>The following is a discussion of each of the Dockerfile commands:</p>
<ul>
<li> The <kbd>ENV</kbd> command tells Docker to use a specialized operating system. This is necessary to overcome a deficiency in Jupyter that keeps obtaining and releasing resources from your machine.</li>
<li> The <kbd>ADD</kbd> command tells Docker where the <kbd>tini</kbd> code is located.</li>
<li> The <kbd>RUN</kbd> command changes access rights to the <kbd>tini</kbd> directory.</li>
<li> The <kbd>ENTRYPOINT</kbd> command tells Docker what to use as the operating system of the Docker instance.</li>
<li>The <kbd>EXPOSE</kbd> command tells Docker what port to expose your Notebook on.</li>
<li> The <kbd>CMD</kbd> command tells Docker what commands to run (once the environment is set up). The <kbd>CMD</kbd> arguments are telling as you see the familiar <kbd>jupyter Notebook</kbd> command that you use to start Jupyter on your machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Docker instance is deployed to your Docker machine, you can access the Docker instance on the machine at the port specified (<kbd>8888</kbd>), such as, <kbd>http://machinename.com:8888</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sharing Notebooks on a public server</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Currently, there is one hosting company that allows you to host your Notebooks for free: GitHub. GitHub is the standard web provider of source control (Git source control) systems. Source control is used to maintain historical versions of your files to allow you to retrace your steps.</p>
<p>GitHub's implementation includes all of the tools that you need to use in your Notebook already installed on the server. For example, in previous chapters, to use R programming in your Notebook, you would have had to install the R toolset on your machine. GitHub has already done all of these steps.</p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> website and sign up for a free website.</p>
<p>Once logged in, you are provided with a website that can be added to. If you have development tools to use (<kbd>git</kbd> push commands are programmer commands to store files on a Git server), you can do that or simply drag and drop you Notebook (<kbd>ipynb</kbd>) file onto your GitHub website.</p>
<p>I created an account there, with a <kbd>notebooks</kbd> directory, and placed one of the <kbd>notebooks</kbd> on that site. My GitHub site looks as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ef9b07a2-e9a0-4d7b-bdee-500abbcfb36a.png"/></p>
<p>You can see the <kbd>Python Data Access.ipynb</kbd> file near the top of the screen.</p>
<p>If you click on that <kbd>notebooks</kbd> file, you see the expected Notebook up and running in your browser.</p>
<p>Note: There is currently a problem running <kbd>notebooks</kbd> on GitHub. It was working. I expect something will get fixed to re-enable Jupyter.</p>
<p>If you look back at the previous chapter, you can see the same display (minus the GitHub adornments).</p>
<p>This Notebook is directly accessible by others using this URL: <a href="https://github.com/danieltoomey/notebooks/blob/master/Python%20Data%20Access.ipynb">https://github.com/danieltoomey/notebooks/blob/master/Python%20Data%20Access.ipynb</a>. So, you can provide your Notebook on GitHub to other users and just hand them the URL.</p>
<p>When you are logged in to GitHub, the display will look slightly different as you will have more control over the GitHub content.</p>

<p>The standard tool for converting Notebooks to other formats is the use of the <kbd>nbconvert</kbd> utility. It is built into your Jupyter installation. You can access the tool directly in the user interface for your Notebook. If you open a Notebook and select the Jupyter File menu item, you will see several options for Download as:</p>

<p>Note: Since we are working with a Scala Notebook, that is the language choice provided on the second choice. If we had a Notebook in another language, that other language would be the choice.</p>
<p>For these examples, if we take a Notebook from a previous chapter, the Jupyter Notebook looks like this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/91263d60-310d-4f94-ac37-ab03d9f9b2e4.png" style="width:51.17em;height:48.92em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Notebook format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Notebook format (<kbd>.ipynb</kbd>) is the native format for your Notebook. We have looked in this file in earlier chapters to see what Jupyter is storing in your Notebook.</p>
<p>You would use the Notebook format if you wanted to give another user complete access to your Notebook, since they would run your Notebook from their system.</p>
<p>You may also want to do this to save your Notebook in another medium.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Scala format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Scala format (<kbd>.scala</kbd>) corresponds to the Scala implementation of your Notebook. If you use JavaScript as the language for your Notebook, this is a direct export of the Notebook page.</p>
<p>If you used another language for the script of the Notebook, Python, for example, then the Download as option would change appropriately, for example, Download as | Python (<kbd>.py</kbd>).</p>
<p>Using our example, as expected the Scala format is equivalent to the Jupyter display:</p>
<pre><strong>import scala.io.Source;</strong> 
 
<strong>//copied file locally https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data</strong> 
<strong>val filename = "iris.data"</strong> 
<strong>//println("SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth, Class");</strong> 
 
<strong>//load iris data into an array</strong> 
<strong>val array = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.empty[Float]</strong> 
<strong>for (line &lt;- Source.fromFile(filename).getLines) {</strong> 
<strong>    var cols = line.split(",").map(_.trim);</strong> 
<strong>    //println(s"${cols(0)}|${cols(1)}|${cols(2)}|${cols(3)} |${cols(4)}");</strong> 
<strong>    val i = cols(0).toFloat</strong> 
<strong>    array += i;</strong> 
<strong>}</strong> 
 
<strong>//get some minimal statistics</strong> 
<strong>val count = array.length;</strong> 
<strong>var min:Double = 9999.0;</strong> 
<strong>var max:Double = 0.0;</strong> 
<strong>var total:Double = 0.0;</strong> 
<strong>for ( x &lt;- array ) {</strong> 
<strong>    if (x &lt; min) { min = x; }</strong> 
<strong>    if (x &gt; max) { max = x; }</strong> 
<strong>    total += x;     </strong> 
<strong>}</strong> 
<strong>val mean:Double = total / count;</strong> </pre>
<p>With the Scala format, you can run the script directly using the Scala interpreter. Under macOS, there is the <kbd>scala</kbd> command. Similar tools exist for Windows machines.</p>
<p>Also, for other scripting languages, you should be able to run the script in the appropriate interpreter.</p>
<p>If we run this Scala file from a command-line window, we see the expected results:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/bee1ef47-ba74-4434-97c9-f484180c4d2b.png"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">HTML format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>HTML (<kbd>.html</kbd>) format corresponds to the HTML needed to display the page in a web browser as it appears in your Notebook. The generated HTML does not have any coding logic; it only has the HTML necessary to display a similar page.</p>
<p>The HTML format would be useful to convey to another user the results of your Notebook. You may want to do this if you wanted to email your Notebook to another user (where the raw HTML would be transported and viewable in an email client application).</p>
<p>HTML is also useful if you have a web service available where you can insert new pages. If the web server does not have support for Jupyter files (refer to the first section of this chapter), HTML may be your only choice. Similarly, you may not want to hand over your source Jupyter Notebook (<kbd>.ipynb</kbd>) file, even if the web server does support Jupyter.</p>
<p>The exported HTML format looks like this in a browser:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7484685e-0e6e-4691-b9fe-ec0c6e47d6a5.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Notice that none of the Jupyter heading information is displayed or available. Otherwise, it looks the same as the Jupyter display.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Markdown format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The markdown (<kbd>.md</kbd>) format is a looser version of <strong>Hyptertext Markdown Language</strong> (<strong>HTML</strong>). <kbd>.md</kbd> files can be used by some tools. It is normally used as the format of README files for software distributions (where the client's display capabilities may be very limited).</p>
<p>For example, the markdown format of the same Notebook is shown as follows:</p>
<pre> 
<strong>```scala211</strong> 
<strong>import scala.io.Source;</strong> 
 
<strong>//copied file locally https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data</strong> 
<strong>val filename = "iris.data"</strong> 
<strong>//println("SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth, Class");</strong> 
 
<strong>//load iris data into an array</strong> 
<strong>val array = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.empty[Float]</strong> 
<strong>for (line &lt;- Source.fromFile(filename).getLines) {</strong> 
<strong>    var cols = line.split(",").map(_.trim);</strong> 
<strong>    //println(s"${cols(0)}|${cols(1)}|${cols(2)}|${cols(3)} |${cols(4)}");</strong> 
<strong>    val i = cols(0).toFloat</strong> 
<strong>    array += i;</strong> 
<strong>}</strong> 
 
<strong>//get some minimal statistics</strong> 
<strong>val count = array.length;</strong> 
<strong>var min:Double = 9999.0;</strong> 
<strong>var max:Double = 0.0;</strong> 
<strong>var total:Double = 0.0;</strong> 
<strong>for ( x &lt;- array ) {</strong> 
<strong>    if (x &lt; min) { min = x; }</strong> 
<strong>    if (x &gt; max) { max = x; }</strong> 
<strong>    total += x;     </strong> 
<strong>}</strong> 
<strong>val mean:Double = total / count;</strong> 
<strong>```</strong> </pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Obviously, the Markdown format is a very low-level display. There are only minor text markings that help the reader determine the different formatting in use. I used the Atom editor to see what this looks like when interpreted:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/1d4ddc12-e8bd-4e8f-9ffc-43c8fad783e0.png" style="width:47.83em;height:47.08em;"/></p>

<p>Again, a very clean display, still resembling the Jupyter Notebook display, with some odd coding at the bottom of the file and lots of escape characters. Not sure why.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Restructured text format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The restructured text format (<kbd>.rst</kbd>) is a simple, plain text markup language that is sometimes used for programming documentation. It looks very similar to the <kbd>.md</kbd> format discussed earlier.</p>
<p>For example, the RST format for the example page looks like this:</p>
<pre> 
<strong>.. code:: scala</strong> 
 
<strong>    import scala.io.Source;</strong> 
<strong>    </strong> 
<strong>    //copied file locally https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data</strong> 
<strong>    val filename = "iris.data"</strong> 
<strong>    //println("SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth, Class");</strong> 
<strong>    </strong> 
<strong>    //load iris data into an array</strong> 
<strong>    val array = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.empty[Float]</strong> 
<strong>    for (line &lt;- Source.fromFile(filename).getLines) {</strong> 
<strong>        var cols = line.split(",").map(_.trim);</strong> 
<strong>        //println(s"${cols(0)}|${cols(1)}|${cols(2)}|${cols(3)} |${cols(4)}");</strong> 
<strong>        val i = cols(0).toFloat</strong> 
<strong>        array += i;</strong> 
<strong>    }</strong> 
<strong>    </strong> 
<strong>    //get some minimal statistics</strong> 
<strong>    val count = array.length;</strong> 
<strong>    var min:Double = 9999.0;</strong> 
<strong>    var max:Double = 0.0;</strong> 
<strong>    var total:Double = 0.0;</strong> 
<strong>    for ( x &lt;- array ) {</strong> 
<strong>        if (x &lt; min) { min = x; }</strong> 
<strong>        if (x &gt; max) { max = x; }</strong> 
<strong>        total += x;     </strong> 
<strong>    }</strong> 
<strong>    val mean:Double = total / count;</strong> 
 
<strong>.. parsed-literal::</strong> 
<strong>...</strong> </pre>
<p>As you can see, it is similar to the markdown in the previous example; the code is roughly broken up into chunks.</p>

<p>Using Atom to display the <kbd>.rst</kbd> file results in this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e0e29c69-f258-4670-976f-cfda9c20bbd4.png"/></p>
<p>The <kbd>.rst</kbd> display is not as nice as some of the others.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">LaTeX format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>LaTeX is a typesetting format from the late 1970s. It is still used on many Unix-dervied systems for producing manuals and the like.</p>

<p>Jupyter uses the LaTeX package to export the image of the Notebook to a PDF file. You would have to install this package on your machine in order for this to work. On macOS, this involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Install LaTeX – there are separate installations for Windows and macOS.</li>
<li> On macOS, I tried using MacTeX. You must use Safari to download the package. It complained about bad formats and I had to retry several times.</li>
<li> On Windows, I tried using TeXLive. It attempts to download hundreds of fonts.</li>
<li> The following (macOS) commands are used for fonts:
<ul>
<li><kbd>sudo tlmgr install adjustbox</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that this install was pretty cumbersome. I had already installed the full LaTeX, then another note said to install a mini version of LaTeX, and then it was tricky to install the fonts. I have very little confidence that these steps will work correctly on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>If you do not have the full set of packages needed, when you try to download the PDF file, a new screen will open in your Notebook and a long error message will be displayed showing what piece is missing.</p>
<p>You can download a text file reader for the particular operating system you are using to work with. I downloaded MacTeX for my macOS.</p>
<p>Note: you will need a Tex interpreter in order to perform the next type of download as a PDF, since it uses Tex as the basis for developing the PDF file.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">PDF format</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The PDF (<kbd>.pdf</kbd>) format is a well-known display format used for many purposes. PDF is a good format for conveying unmodifiable content to other users. The other users will not be able to modify the results in any way, but they will be able to see and understand your logic.</p>
<p>PDF generation is dependent upon LaTeX being installed correctly. I was not able to get this running this time. I have successfully installed it on Windows and Mac in prior versions.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we shared Notebooks on a Notebook server. We added a Notebook to our web server, and we distributed a Notebook using GitHub. We also looked into converting our Notebooks into different formats, such as HTML and PDF.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look into allowing multiple users to interact with a Notebook simultaneously.</p>

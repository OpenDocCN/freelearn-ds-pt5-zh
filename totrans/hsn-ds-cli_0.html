<p class="mce-root">In this book, we introduce the power of the command line using the bash shell. Bash is the most widely accepted shell, and is found on everything from toasters to high-performance computers. We start with the basics and quickly move to some more advanced skills throughout the book. </p>

<p class="mce-root"><em>Hands-On Data Science with the Command Line</em> provides useful tips and tricks on how to use the command line for everyday data problems. This book is aimed for the reader that has little to no command-line experience but has worked in the field of computer science and/or has experience with modern data science problems. </p>
<p>You'll learn how to set up the command line on multiple platforms and configure it to your liking, learn how to find help with commands, and learn how to create reusable scripts. You will also learn how to obtain an actual dataset, perform some analytics, and learn how to visualize the data. Towards the end of the book, we touch on some of the advanced features of the command line and where to go from there.</p>
<p>In addition, all of the code examples are available to download in Packt's GitHub account. Any updates to this book will be made available to you by the Packt platform.</p>

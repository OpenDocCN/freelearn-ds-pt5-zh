I tried to provide a good mix between diving into the fundamentals of a particular topic, such as deep learning or time series analysis, and giving comprehensive example code for the practitioner. I especially hope that you found the idea of tightly integrating the data science analytics with the PixieApp application programming model in a single Jupyter Notebook interesting and novel. But, most importantly, I hope that you found it useful and something you can reuse in your own projects and with your own teams.</p><p>At the beginning of <a class="link" href="ch01.xhtml" title="Chapter 1. Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset</em>, I use the Drew's Conway Venn Diagram (which is one of my favorites) as a representation of what is data science and why data scientists are widely considered unicorns. With all respect to Drew Conway, I'd like to extend this diagram to denote the important and growing role of developers in the field of data science, as shown in the following diagram:</p><div><img src="img/B09699_10_01.jpg" alt="The Future of Data Analysis and Where to Develop your Skills" width="926" height="872"/><div><p>Drew's Conway Venn Diagram for data science that now includes developers</p></div></div><p>I'd now like to take advantage of this last chapter to provide my views for the future and what to expect when it comes to AI and data science.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec67"/>Forward thinking – what to expect for AI and data science</h1></div></div></div><p>This is the part I like <a id="id737" class="indexterm"/>a lot as I get to express forward-looking opinions without being held accountable for accuracy since, by definition, these are only <a id="id738" class="indexterm"/>my opinions <img src="img/B09699_10_02.jpg" alt="Forward thinking – what to expect for AI and data science" width="21" height="19"/>.</p><p>As I explained in <a class="link" href="ch01.xhtml" title="Chapter 1. Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset</em>, I believe that AI and data science are here to stay, and they will continue to cause disruption to existing industries for the foreseeable future, most likely at an accelerating rate. This will certainly have an effect on the overall number of jobs and, similar to other technological revolutions we've seen in the past (agricultural, industrial, information, and many more), some will disappear, while new ones will be created.</p><p>In 2016, Ginny Rometty, IBM Chairman, and CEO, in a letter to President Donald Trump (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect">https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect</a>), talks about the need to better prepare for the AI revolution by creating new types of jobs that she calls "new collar," as shown in the following excerpt:</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"Getting a job at today's IBM does not always require a college degree; at some of our centers in the United States, as many as one third of employees have less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes obtained through vocational training. In addition, we are creating and hiring to fill "new collar" jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence and cognitive business."</p></blockquote></div><p>These "new collar" jobs can only be created in sufficient numbers if we are successful in our quest to democratize data science, because data science is the lifeblood of AI and everyone needs to be involved in some capacity; developers, line of business users, data engineers, and so on. It is easy to imagine that the demand for these new types of jobs will be so high that traditional academic tracks will not be able to fill the needs. Rather, it will be incumbent upon the industry to fill the void by creating new programs designed to retrain all existing workers whose jobs may be at risk of becoming redundant. New programs similar to the <em>Everyone Can Code</em> program from Apple (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.apple.com/everyone-can-code">https://www.apple.com/everyone-can-code</a>) will emerge; perhaps something like <em>Anyone can do Data Science</em>. I also think that <strong>MOOCs</strong> (short for, <strong>Massive Open Online Courses</strong>) will play an <a id="id739" class="indexterm"/>even greater role that we already see today with the many partnerships being formed between key MOOC players such as <a id="id740" class="indexterm"/>Coursera and edX, and companies like IBM (see <a class="ulink" href="https://www.coursera.org/ibm">https://www.coursera.org/ibm</a>).</p><p>There are other things companies can do in order to better prepare for the AI and data science revolution. In <a class="link" href="ch01.xhtml" title="Chapter 1. Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset</em>, I talk about three pillars <a id="id741" class="indexterm"/>for a data science strategy that can help us <a id="id742" class="indexterm"/>with this ambitious goal: data, services, and tools.</p><p>On the services side, high growth in public clouds is substantially contributing to the overall increase in high-quality services in multiple fields: data persistence, cognitive, streaming, and so on. Providers such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are taking a leading role in building innovative capabilities with a service-first approach backed by a strong platform that provides a consistent experience for developers. This trend will continue to accelerate, with more and more powerful services being released at an increasingly rapid rate.</p><p>A good example <a id="id743" class="indexterm"/>is Google self-learning AI called AlphaZero (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero</a>), which taught itself chess in 4 hours and went on to beat a champion chess program. Another great example comes from IBM's recently announced project debater (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/project-debater">https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/project-debater</a>), which is the first AI system that can debate a human on complex topics. These types of advances will continue to fuel the availability of more and more powerful services that can be accessed by everyone, including developers. Chatbots are another example of services that have been successfully democratized as it has never been easier for developers to create applications that contain conversational capabilities. I believe that consuming these services will become easier and easier over time, enabling developers to build amazing new applications that we can't even begin to imagine today.</p><p>On the data side, we need to make accessing high-quality data much easier than it is today. One model I have in mind is coming from a television show called <em>24</em>. Full disclosure; I love watching, and binging on, TV series and I think that some of them provide a good indicator of where technology is headed. In <em>24</em>, Jack Bauer, a counter-terrorism agent, has 24 hours to stop bad guys from causing catastrophic events. Watching that show, I'm <a id="id744" class="indexterm"/>always amazed at how easy the <a id="id745" class="indexterm"/>data circulates from the analyst back at the command center to the mobile phone of Jack Bauer, or how, given a data problem with only minutes to solve, the analyst is able to summon the data from different systems (satellite images, system of records, and so on) to zero-in on the bad guys; for example, we're looking for someone who bought this type of chemicals in the last 2 months and within a given radius. Wow! from my perspective, this is how easy and frictionless it should be for data scientists to access and process data. I believe we are making great progress toward this goal with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks that act as a control plane for connecting data sources with services and analytics that process them. Jupyter Notebooks bring tools to the data instead of the opposite, thus lowering greatly the cost of entry for anyone who wants to get involved in data science.</p></div></div></div>

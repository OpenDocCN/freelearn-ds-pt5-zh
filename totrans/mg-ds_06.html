<p class="p1">Since you are reading this book, it's likely you already understand the importance of teamwork. You can complete a complex project with a team more efficiently than in isolation. Of course, one person can build a house alone, but by working with others, they will finish the house faster, and the result will be better.</p>
<p class="p1">When you work with a team, everyone can specialize in performing several closely-related types of work. To explore different specialties, let's look at an example of how houses are built. Building a roof requires one set of skills, while setting up electricity is completely different. As a manager, you need to have a basic understanding of all specialties, so as to understand all components necessary for completing a task. In the <em>What is Data Science?</em> section, you were introduced to the central concepts of data science. Then, we will use this knowledge to derive roles and specialties in a data science team. In this chapter, we will define, explore, and understand different team roles as well as each role's key skills and responsibilities. We will also look at two case studies. </p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>

<li>Defining data science team roles</li>

<p>Data science teams need to deliver complex projects where system analysis, software engineering, data engineering, and data science are used to deliver the final solution. In this section, we will explore the main data science project roles. The project role depicts a set of related activities that can be performed by an expert. Role-expert is not strictly a one-to-one correspondence, as many experts have the expertise to handle multiple roles at once.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p1">An average data science team will include a business analyst, a system analyst, a data scientist, a data engineer, and a data science team manager. More complex projects may also benefit from the participation of a software architect and backend/frontend development teams.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the core responsibilities of each team role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project stakeholders</strong>: Represent people who are interested in the project; in other words, your customers. They generate and prioritize high-level requirements and goals for the project.</li>
<li><strong>Project users</strong>: People who will use the solution you are building. They should be involved in the requirements-specification process to present a practical view on the system's usability.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Let's look at the core responsibilities in the analysis team:<span> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Business analysts</strong>: The main business expert of the team. They help to shape business requirements and help data scientists to understand the details about the problem domain. They define business requirements in the form of a <strong>business requirements document</strong> (<strong>BRD</strong>), or stories, and may act as a product owner in agile teams.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>System analysts</strong>: They define, shape, and maintain software and integration requirements. They create a <strong>software requirements document</strong> (<strong>SRD</strong>). In simple projects or <strong>Proof of Concepts</strong> (<strong>PoC</strong>), this role can be handled by other team members.</li>
<li><strong>Data analysts</strong>: Analysis in data science projects often requires building complex database queries and visualizing data. Data analysts can support other team members by creating datamarts and interactive dashboards and derive insights from data.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Let's look at the core responsibilities in the data<strong> </strong>team: </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Data scientists</strong>: They create models, perform statistical analysis, and handle other tasks related to data science. For most projects, it will be sufficient to select and apply existing algorithms. An expert who specializes in applying existing algorithms to solve practical problems is called a <strong>machine</strong> or <strong>deep learning engineer</strong>. However, some projects may ask for research and the creation of new state-of-the-art models. For these tasks, a machine or deep learning researcher will be a better fit. For those readers with computer science backgrounds, we can loosely describe the difference between a machine learning engineer and research scientist as the difference between a software engineer and a computer scientist.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Data engineers</strong>:<span> They </span>handle all data preparation and data processing. In simple projects, data scientists with data engineering skills can handle this role. However, do not underestimate the importance of data engineers in projects with serious data processing requirements. Big data technology stacks are very complicated to set up and work with on a large scale, and there is no one better to handle this task than data engineers.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Data science team manager</strong>: They coordinate all tasks for the data team, plan activities, and control deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Let's look at the core responsibilities in the software<strong> </strong>team: </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Software teams</strong><span> </span>should handle all additional requirements for building mobile, web, and desktop applications. Depending on the ramifications, the software development can be handled by a single developer, a single team, or even several teams.</li>
<li class="li2">In large projects that comprise multiple systems, you may need the help of a <strong>software architect</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's now see the general flow of how roles can work together to build the final solution:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b4d290fb-f368-4763-8a1c-9b8502e1341b.png" width="2599" height="1537"/></p>
<p>Let's look at the flow and delivery artifacts of each step:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>business</strong> <strong>analyst </strong>documents business requirements based on querying project stakeholders and users.</li>
<li>The <strong>system analyst </strong>documents system (technical) requirements based on business requirements and querying project stakeholders and users.</li>
<li>The <strong>data analyst </strong>supports the team by creating requested datamarts and dashboards. They can be used by everyone on the team in the development process, as well as in production. If the data analyst uses a Business Intelligence tool, they can build dashboards directly for end users.</li>
<li>The <strong>data scientist (researcher) </strong>uses documented requirements and raw data to build a model training pipeline and document data processing requirements that should be used to prepare training, validation, and testing datasets.</li>
<li>The <strong>data engineer </strong>builds a production-ready data pipeline based on the prototype made in <em>Step 3</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>data scientist (engineer) </strong>uses processed data to build a production-ready model for training and prediction pipelines and all necessary integrations, including model APIs.</li>
<li>The <strong>software team </strong>uses the complete model training and prediction pipelines to build the final solution.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">Please note that this process can be simplified or more granular depending on project complexity. For example, large projects may require splitting analysis experts into two groups: data and software analysis. Then, the software team will have separate requirements documentation. Simpler projects might fuse some steps or roles together, or omit them.</div>
<p>In the next section, we will look at how to assemble teams and assign project roles to experts depending on project complexity.</p>

<p class="p1">To complete a data science project, you will need a data scientist. Can a single expert lead a project? To answer this question, we can break down data science projects into stages and tasks that are, to some extent, present in all projects.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p1">Before starting a project, you need an idea that will allow your client to achieve their goals and simplify their life. In business, you will look to improve key business processes within a company. Sometimes, the idea is already worked out, and you may start directly from implementation, but more often, your team will be the driver of the process. So, our ideal expert must be able to come up with an idea of a data science project that will provide value for the client. </p>
<p>Next, we will study two project examples to look at how simple projects can be handled with small teams or even one cross-functional expert, while larger projects need more diverse teams, where each team member handles one or two specific roles.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Case study 1 – Applying machine learning to prevent fraud in banks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1">To explore what data science projects can be like, we will look at a case study. Mary is working as a data scientist in a bank where the fraud analysis department became interested in <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>). She is experienced in creating machine learning models and integrating them into existing systems by building APIs. Mary also has experience in presenting the results of her work to the customer.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the main activities of this department is to detect and prevent credit card fraud. They do this by using a rule-based, fraud detection system. This system looks over all credit card transactions happening in the bank and checks whether any series of transactions should be considered fraudulent. Each check is hardcoded and predetermined. They have heard that ML brings benefits over traditional, rule-based, fraud detection systems. So, they have asked Mary to implement a fraud detection model as a plugin for their existing system. Mary has inquired about the datasets and operators of the current fraud detection system, and the department confirmed that they will provide all necessary data from the system itself. The only thing they need is a working model, and a simple software integration. The staff were already familiar with common classification metrics, so they were advised to use F1-score with k-fold cross-validation.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p1">In this project setup, project stakeholders have already finished the business analysis stage. They have an idea and a success criterion. Mary has clean and easy access to the data source from a single system, and stakeholders can define a task in terms of a classification problem. They have also defined a clear way to test the results. The software integration requirements are also simple. Thus, the role flow of the project is simplified to just a few steps, which are all performed by a single data scientist role:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-346 image-border" src="Images/a7480602-35dc-42a7-94e1-76a59257f205.png" style="width:223.42em;height:51.08em;" width="2681" height="613"/></p>
<p class="p1">As a result, Mary has laid out the following steps to complete the tasks:</p>
<ol class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Create a machine learning model.</li>
<li class="li2">Test it.</li>
<li>Create a model training pipeline.</li>
<li class="li2">Create a simple integration API.</li>
<li class="li2">Document and communicate the results to the customer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">This project looks simple and well-defined. Based on this description, we can believe that Mary can handle it by herself, with little supervision.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Case study 2 – Finding a home for machine learning in a retail company</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1">Now, let's look into another case. The retail company where our friend Jonathan works asked him to generate ideas of how they can apply data science and analytics to improve their business. Jonathan worked in retail for many years, so he knows the business side pretty well. He has also read some books and attended several data science events, so he understands the practical capabilities of data science. With knowledge of both business and data science, Jonathan can see how data science can change his environment. After writing out a list of ideas, he will evaluate them from the business viewpoint. Projects with the lowest complexity and highest value will become candidates for implementation.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p1">The retail company has over 10,000 stores across the country, and ensuring the proper level of service quality for all stores is becoming difficult. Each store has a fixed number of staff members working full-time. However, each store has a different number of visitors. This number depends on the geographical location of the store, holidays, and possibly many more unknown factors. As a result, some stores are overcrowded and some experience a low number of visits. Jonathan's idea is to change the staff employment strategy so that customer satisfaction will rise, and the employee burden will even out.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of hiring a fixed store team, he suggests making it elastic. He wants to create a special mobile application that will allow stores to adjust their staff list with great speed. In this application, a store manager can create a task for a worker. The task can be as short as one hour or as long as one year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A pool of workers will see all vacant slots in nearby stores. If a worker with the necessary skills sees a task that interests them, they can accept it and go to the store. An algorithm will prepare task suggestions for the store manager, who will issue work items to the pool. This algorithm will use multiple machine learning models to recommend tasks. One model would forecast the expected customer demand for each store. The second model, a computer vision algorithm, will measure the length of the lines in the store. This way, each store will use the right amount of workforce, changing it based on demand levels. With the new app, store employees will be able to plan vacations and ask for a temporary replacement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Calculations show that this model will keep 50,000 workers with an average load of 40 hours per week for each worker, and a pool of 10,000 part-time workers with an average load of 15 hours per week. Management considered this model to be more economically viable and agreed to perform a test of the system in one store. If the test is successful, they will continue expanding the new policy.</p>
<p class="p1">The next thing they ask Jonathan is to come up with an implementation plan. He now needs to decompose the project into a series of tasks that are necessary to deploy the system in one store. Jonathan prepared the following decomposition:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2">Collect and document initial requirements for the mobile app, forecasting, and computer vision models.</li>
<li class="li2">Collect and document non-functional requirements and Service Level Agreements for the system.</li>
<li class="li2">Decide on necessary hardware resources for development, testing, and production.</li>
<li class="li2">Find data sources with training data.</li>
<li class="li2">Create data adapters for exporting data from source systems.</li>
<li class="li2">Create a software system architecture. Choose the technology stack.</li>
<li class="li2">Create development, test, and production environments.</li>
<li class="li2">Develop a forecasting model (full ML project life cycle).</li>
<li class="li2">Develop a line-length recognition model (full ML project life cycle).</li>
</ol>
<ol class="ol1" start="10">
<li class="li2">Develop a mobile app.</li>
<li class="li2">Integrate the mobile app with the models.</li>
<li class="li2">Deploy the system to the test environment and perform an end-to-end system test.</li>
<li class="li2">Deploy the system to the production environment.</li>
<li class="li2">Start the system test in one store.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Each point in this plan could be broken down further into 10-20 additional tasks. A full task decomposition for this project could easily include 200 points, but we will stop at this level, as it is sufficient for discussion purposes.</p>
<p class="p1">In reality, plans constantly change, so Jonathan has also decided to use a software development project management framework, such as SCRUM, to manage deadlines, requirement changes, and stakeholder expectations.</p>
<p class="p1">Let's now see what areas of expertise Jonathan needs to be proficient in order to complete this project. He needs to be adept in the following areas:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Retail business</li>
<li class="li2">Software project management</li>
<li class="li2">Requirements-collection</li>
<li class="li2">Software and hardware architecture</li>
<li class="li2">Data engineering</li>
<li class="li2">Data science</li>
<li class="li2">Machine learning</li>
<li class="li2">Deep learning and computer vision</li>
<li class="li2">Mobile application development</li>
<li class="li2">Backend software development</li>
<li class="li2">Software integration</li>
<li class="li2">Software testing</li>
<li class="li2">Development operations</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Can Jonathan possess all those skills on a level necessary to deliver a working software system? We can be sure that there are a few people who can do this, but it is far more likely to meet an expert who knows several closely related domains. In particular, a data engineer is likely to be good with databases, database administration, and software integration. Many data scientists are also good with backend software development. Some are proficient in creating data visualization dashboards. <span>In terms of the </span><span>role flow of the project, the full diagram can be used for this project.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p1">In an average data science project, expect to fill in the following team roles:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Data scientist
<ul>
<li>Machine or deep learning engineer</li>
<li>Machine or deep learning researcher</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li2">Data engineer</li>
<li>Data analyst</li>
<li>Systems analyst</li>
<li>Business analyst</li>
<li class="li2">Backend software developer</li>
<li class="li2">Frontend software developer</li>
<li class="li2">Technical team leader</li>
<li class="li2">Project manager</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Depending on the project's complexity, you can merge some of these roles. The bigger your project scale, the more diverse and large your team will be. Next, we will look at the key skills and responsibilities of data science team roles.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Key skills of a data scientist</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1">A data scientist is a relatively new profession, and vague definitions of their responsibilities are common. This uncertainty leads to many problems. Generic position descriptions on job boards are unappealing to good candidates. Professionals looking for a job won't be able to figure out what's required from them to get this position if you don't crystallize this definition in your head first. If someone goes to a job without knowing what is expected of them, it becomes even worse. Without a clear goal, or at least a clear definition, of the next milestone, your team will get lost. Defining clear responsibilities for team roles is the basis that will allow your team to function coherently.</p>
<p class="p1">An ideal data scientist is often described as a mix of the following three things:</p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Domain expertise</strong>: This includes knowledge of an environment data scientists are working in, such as healthcare, retail, insurance, or finance.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Software engineering</strong>: Even the most advanced model won't make a difference if it can only present pure mathematical abstractions. Data scientists need to know how to shape their ideas into a usable form.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Data science</strong>: Data scientists need to be proficient in mathematics, statistics, and one or more key areas of data science, such as machine learning, deep learning, or time series analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p1">It is important to understand why each area of expertise is present in this list. We will start with the domain expertise. You are very unlikely to find a world-class business expert who can also train state-of-the-art deep learning models. The good thing is that you don't need to search for unicorns. A data scientist needs domain expertise mainly to understand data. It is also handy when working with requirements and stakeholder expectations. A basic to medium understanding of insurance business can help data scientists throughout the process of building a model.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, let's look at how business expertise can help to build models for an insurance company:</p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li2">Speaking with insurance experts in the same language can help to discover their pain and desires, so the data scientist can adjust their goals to achieve better results.</li>
<li class="li2">Insurance expertise will help in exploring and understanding the raw data from the company's databases.</li>
<li class="li2">Insurance expertise can help in data preprocessing. It aids data scientists in assembling datasets for machine learning models.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Thus, domain expertise is not the prime skill for a data scientist, but a basic to medium level of understanding can improve results by a large margin.</p>
<p class="p1">The next component, software engineering expertise, is often overlooked. Algorithms are often tied to the most critical processes of an organization, hence, the availability and stability requirements for these algorithms are high. Data scientists never create an abstract model. Even in research organizations, data scientists write code. And the closer you are to real-world applications, the more good code matters. Good programming skills allow data scientists to write well-architected, well-documented, and reusable code other team members can understand. Software engineering expertise enables them to build systems that do not fail under high loads and can scale from simple proof-of-concept tests to organization-wide deployments.</p>
<p class="p1">And last, but not least, are the data science skills. They are key tools without which no one can build a working model. However, data science is a very wide field. Be sure to understand what algorithms you will need to use, and understand what kind of expert you need. A computer vision expert won't be the best fit for a movie recommender project. If you hire a data scientist, it does not automatically mean that they are proficient in all areas of machine learning and mathematical statistics.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Discovering the purpose of the interview process</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>First, you should figure out why you need to do interviews. Let's do a quick exercise. Ask yourself why and write out answers until there is nothing left to say. After that, recall the last interview that you did. Was it well aligned with your goals? The results should give you an instant vector for improvement.</p>
<p>From the employer's side, the sole purpose of the interview is to fill the position with a capable candidate. From the side of the employee, the purpose of the interview is to find a good team, an interesting project, a reliable company to work with, and satisfactory compensation. We often forget that the interview is a dialogue, not a mere test of skill.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no clear and ubiquitous definition of the main interview goal. That is because each goal is unique for each position. You should define this goal based on the detailed understanding of the job you are interviewing for. If you are looking for a data scientist, define rigorously what you expect them to do. What tasks will the new team member solve? Think deeply about what the first working day in this position will look like. What are the core responsibilities? What skills are useful but not mandatory? Based on that, you can start drafting a set of desired skills for the candidates. Be specific. If you demand knowledge of SQL, then be sure to have a definite reason for this requirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If your interview goal is to find an ideal, top 0.1 percentile, world-class expert, then think again. The primary goal is to find an able person who can do the job. It might be that this person must be the best expert in the world. If so, this requirement should be explained and justified. To create this understanding, you need to describe what the job will be like. After you decide that the description is finished, rewrite it with the candidate in mind. It should be short, easy to read, and give a complete idea of that the job will be like and what the expectations are. The ambiguity of job descriptions often comes from a lack of this understanding. <em>We just need someone</em>, their job description says. Yours should say <em>We know exactly what we need, and you can rely on us</em>. If you can't, do you really need to post a new job?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Concrete understanding of your goals will be helpful in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will understand what kind of expert you should search for.</li>
<li>Candidates looking at your job description will know exactly what you expect of them. It will be easier to judge whether their experience is relevant or not.</li>
<li>Clear goal definitions will allow you to design purposeful and insightful interview questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your requirements list looks too long, try to simplify it. Maybe you were overzealous and some skills you have listed are not vital. Or perhaps you could consider hiring two people with different backgrounds? If you are posting a job description with a wide cross-functional set of requirements, be sure to have a reason behind it.</p>
<p>If your job description is complex, then you will find the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The candidate search will take longer since you are demanding more skills and experience.</li>
<li>The candidates will expect a higher salary.</li>
<li>The interview process will be long and could extend to several sessions.</li>
<li>You will have fewer options to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<p>All those restrictions should have good supporting arguments. If you have none, consider simplifying.</p>
<p>Having a good goal is not all you need, the execution matters too. We will now look at the interview process from the candidate's standpoint to discuss the topics of bias and empathy.</p>

<p class="p1">As a project becomes more complex, managing data becomes difficult. Your system may consume data from many sources, some of them being real-time data streams, while others may be static databases. Volumes of data that your system will need to process can also be large. All this leads to the creation of a data processing subsystem that manages and orchestrates all data streams. Managing large volumes of data and creating systems that can process large volumes of data quickly requires the usage of highly specialized software stacks suited to this task.</p>
<p class="p1">Hence, a separate role of a data engineer emerges. The key areas of knowledge for data engineers are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Software engineering</strong></li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Big</strong> <strong>data engineering</strong>: This includes distributed data processing frameworks, data streaming technologies, and various orchestration frameworks. Data engineers also need to be proficient with the main software architecture patterns related to data processing.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Database management and data warehousing</strong>: Relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Software engineering skills are very important for data engineers. Data transformation code frequently suffers from bad design choices. Following the best practices of software design will ensure that all data processing jobs will be modular, reusable, and easily readable.</p>
<p class="p1">Working with big data involves creating highly parallel code, so a knowledge of distributed processing systems is also essential. Major software platforms, such as the Hadoop ecosystem, Apache Spark, and Apache Kafka, all require a good understanding of their internals to write performant and stable code.</p>
<p class="p1">Understanding classical relational database systems and data warehousing methodologies is also an important skill for a data engineer. Relational databases are a very frequent choice for data storage in large corporations. SQL is so widespread that we can consider it the <em>lingua franca</em> of data. So you can expect <strong>Relational Database Management Systems</strong> (<span><strong>RDBMS</strong>)</span> to be a frequent data source in your projects. Relational databases are very good at storing and querying structured data, so there is a good chance that your project will also use them if the data volumes are moderate. Experience with popular NoSQL databases is also convenient.</p>

<p>In this section, we will look at a few of the skills a data science manager needs to have, namely:</p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Management</strong>: A <span>data science team manager should have a good understanding of the main software management methodologies, such as SCRUM and Kanban. They should also know approaches and specific strategies for managing data science projects.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Domain expertise</strong>: They <span>should know the business domain well. Without it, task decomposition and prioritization becomes impossible, and the project will inevitably go astray.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Data science</strong>: <span>A good understanding of the basic concepts behind data science and machine learning is essential. Without it, you will be building a house without knowing what a house is. It will streamline communication and help to create good task decompositions and stories.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Software engineering</strong>: <span>Knowledge of basic software engineering will ensure that the manager can keep an eye on crucial aspects of a project, such as software architecture and technical debt. Good software project managers have development experience. This experience taught them to write automated tests, refactoring, and building a good architecture. Unfortunately, many data science projects suffer from bad software design choices. Taking shortcuts is only good in the short term; in the long term, they</span><span> will come back to bite you. Projects tend to scale with time; as the team increases, a number of integrations grow, and new requirements arrive. Bad software design paralyzes the project, leaving you with only one option—a complete rewrite of the system.</span></li>

<p class="p1">Creating data products is tied to creating new software systems. Large-scale projects may have many software requirements, including building a UI, developer APIs, and creating role-based workflows in your system. Be sure to get help from a software development team with software engineers, analysts, and architects when you feel that the data science team cannot handle everything by themselves. You may be good to go with a data science team if the only thing you need to build besides a machine learning model is a couple of REST services, data integration jobs, and a simple admin UI. But be sure to expand your team if you need to handle something more complex than that.</p>

<p><span>In this chapter, we first covered what a data scientist is. Then, we looked at two examples that showed us whether a data scientist can work in isolation or needs a team. Next, we looked at the various skills and qualities that a data scientist, a data engineer, and a data science manager need to have. We also briefly explored when we need to ask for help from the development team.</span></p>
<p>Finally, we defined the key domains of a data science team, which are analysis, data, and software. In those domains, we defined project roles that will allow you to create a balanced and powerful team. We may solve simple projects with small teams where team members share responsibilities for different roles. But when the project's complexity grows, your organizational structure will need to scale with it. We also noted the importance of following the best practices <span>of software engineering </span>and sourcing help from software development teams.</p>
<p class="p1">Knowing that defining responsibilities and expectations is critical for delivering complex data science projects, we will use those ideas in the next chapter, where we will explore how to create effective hiring procedures for data science teams.</p>

- en: A web search for "data science Venn diagram" returns numerous interpretations
    of the skills required to be an effective data scientist (it appears that data
    science commentators love Venn diagrams). Author and data scientist Drew Conway
    produced the prototypical diagram back in 2010, putting data science at the intersection
    of hacking skills, substantive expertise (that is, subject domain understanding),
    and mathematics and statistics knowledge. Between hacking skills and substantive
    expertise—those practicing without strong mathematics and statistics knowledge—lies
    the "danger zone."

- en: Five years on, as a growing number of developers seek to plug the data science
    skills' shortage, there's more need than ever for statistical and mathematical
    education to help developers out of this danger zone. So, when Packt Publishing
    invited me to write a book on data science suitable for Clojure programmers, I
    gladly agreed. In addition to appreciating the need for such a book, I saw it
    as an opportunity to consolidate much of what I had learned as CTO of my own Clojure-based
    data analytics company. The result is the book I wish I had been able to read
    before starting out.

- en: '*Clojure for Data Science* aims to be much more than just a book of statistics
    for Clojure programmers. A large reason for the spread of data science into so
    many diverse areas is the enormous power of machine learning. Throughout the book,
    I''ll show how to use pure Clojure functions and third-party libraries to construct
    machine learning models for the primary tasks of regression, classification, clustering,
    and recommendation.'

- en: Approaches that scale to very large datasets, so-called "big data," are of particular
    interest to data scientists, because they can reveal subtleties that are lost
    in smaller samples. This book shows how Clojure can be used to concisely express
    jobs to run on the Hadoop and Spark distributed computation frameworks, and how
    to incorporate machine learning through the use of both dedicated external libraries
    and general optimization techniques.

- en: Above all, this book aims to foster an understanding not just on how to perform
    particular types of analysis, but why such techniques work. In addition to providing
    practical knowledge (almost every concept in this book is expressed as a runnable
    example), I aim to explain the theory that will allow you to take a principle
    and apply it to related problems. I hope that this approach will enable you to
    effectively apply statistical thinking in diverse situations well into the future,
    whether or not you decide to pursue a career in data science.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml "Chapter 1. Statistics"), *Statistics*, introduces Incanter,
    Clojure''s primary statistical computing library used throughout the book. With
    reference to the data from the elections in the United Kingdom and Russia, we
    demonstrate the use of summary statistics and the value of statistical distributions
    while showing a variety of comparative visualizations.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml "Chapter 2. Inference"), *Inference*, covers the difference
    between samples and populations, and statistics and parameters. We introduce hypothesis
    testing as a formal means of determining whether the differences are significant
    in the context of A / B testing website designs. We also cover sample bias, effect
    size, and solutions to the problem of multiple testing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml "Chapter 3. Correlation"), *Correlation*, shows how
    we can discover linear relationships between variables and use the relationship
    to make predictions about some variables given others. We implement linear regression—a
    machine learning algorithm—to predict the weights of Olympic swimmers given their
    heights, using only core Clojure functions. We then make our model more sophisticated
    using matrices and more data to improve its accuracy.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml "Chapter 4. Classification"), *Classification*, describes
    how to implement several different types of machine learning algorithm (logistic
    regression, naive Bayes, C4.5, and random forests) to make predictions about the
    survival rates of passengers on the Titanic. We learn about another test for statistical
    significance that works for categories instead of continuous values, explain various
    issues you''re likely to encounter while training machine learning models such
    as bias and overfitting, and demonstrate how to use the clj-ml machine learning
    library.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml "Chapter 5. Big Data"), *Big Data*, shows how Clojure
    can leverage the parallel capabilities in computers of all sizes using the reducers
    library, and how to scale up these techniques to clusters of machines on Hadoop
    with Tesser and Parkour. Using ZIP code level tax data from the IRS, we demonstrate
    how to perform statistical analysis and machine learning in a scalable way.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml "Chapter 6. Clustering"), *Clustering*, shows how to
    identify text documents that share similar subject matter using Hadoop and the
    Java machine learning library, Mahout. We describe a variety of techniques particular
    to text processing as well as more general concepts related to clustering. We
    also introduce some more advanced features of Parkour that can help get the best
    performance from your Hadoop jobs.'

    covers a variety of different approaches to the challenge of recommendation. In
    addition to implementing a recommender with core Clojure functions, we tackle
    the ancillary challenge of dimensionality reduction by using principle component
    analysis and singular value decomposition, as well as probabilistic set compression
    using Bloom filters and the MinHash algorithm. Finally, we introduce the Sparkling
    and MLlib libraries for machine learning on the Spark distributed computation
    framework and use them to produce movie recommendations with alternating least
    squares.'

    shows a variety of ways of analyzing graph-structured data. We demonstrate the
    methods of traversal using the Loom library and then show how to use the Glittering
    and GraphX libraries with Spark to discover communities and influencers in social
    networks.'

    how to fit curves to simple time series data. Using data on the monthly airline
    passenger counts, we show how to forecast future values for more complex series
    by training an autoregressive moving-average model. We do this by implementing
    a method of parameter optimization called maximum likelihood estimation with help
    from the Apache Commons Math library.'

    how the Clojure library Quil can be used to create custom visualizations for charts
    not provided by Incanter, and attractive graphics that can communicate findings
    clearly to your audience, whatever their background.'

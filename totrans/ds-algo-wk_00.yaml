- en: Data science is a discipline at the intersection of machine learning, statistics,
    and data mining with the objective of gaining new knowledge from existing data
    by means of algorithmic and statistical analysis. In this book, you will learn
    the seven most important ways in data science of analyzing the data. Each chapter
    first explains its algorithm or analysis as a simple concept, supported by a trivial
    example. Further examples and exercises are used to build and expand your knowledge
    of a particular type of analysis.

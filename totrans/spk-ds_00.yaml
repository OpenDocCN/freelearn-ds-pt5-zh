- en: In this smart age, data analytics is the key to sustaining and promoting business
    growth. Every business is trying to leverage their data as much possible with
    all sorts of data science tools and techniques to progress along the analytics
    maturity curve. This sudden rise in data science requirements is the obvious reason
    for scarcity of data scientists. It is very difficult to meet the market demand
    with unicorn data scientists who are experts in statistics, machine learning,
    mathematical modelling as well as programming.

- en: The availability of unicorn data scientists is only going to decrease with the
    increase in market demand, and it will continue to be so. So, a solution was needed
    which not only empowers the unicorn data scientists to do more, but also creates
    what Gartner calls as  “Citizen Data Scientists”. Citizen data scientists are
    none other than the developers, analysts, BI professionals or other technologists
    whose primary job function is outside of statistics or analytics but are passionate
    enough to learn data science. They are becoming the key enabler in democratizing
    data analytics across organizations and industries as a whole.

- en: There is an ever going plethora of tools and techniques designed to facilitate
    big data analytics at scale. This book is an attempt to create citizen data scientists
    who can leverage Apache Spark’s distributed computing platform for data analytics.

- en: This book is a practical guide to learn statistical analysis and machine learning
    to build scalable data products. It helps to master the core concepts of data
    science and also Apache Spark to help you jump start on any real life data analytics
    project. Throughout the book, all the chapters are supported by sufficient examples,
    which can be executed on a home computer, so that readers can easily follow and
    absorb the concepts. Every chapter attempts to be self-contained so that the reader
    can start from any chapter with pointers to relevant chapters for details. While
    the chapters start from basics for a beginner to learn and comprehend, it is comprehensive
    enough for a senior architects at the same time.

<p class="mce-root">Data science and machine learning can transform any organization and open new opportunities. Any data science project is a unique mix of research, software engineering, and business expertise. A substantial managerial effort is needed to guide the solution from prototype development to production. Traditional approaches often fail as they have different conditions and requirements in mind. This book presents a proven approach to data science project management, with tips and best practices to guide you along the way.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of this book, you will learn about the practical applications of data science and AI and will be able to incorporate them into your solutions. You will go through the data science project life cycle, explore the common pitfalls encountered at each step, and learn how to avoid them. Any data science project requires a balanced skillful team, and this book will present helpful advice for hiring and growing a skillful data science team for your organization. The book also shows you how you can efficiently manage and improve your data science projects through the use of DevOps.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the book, readers will have the practical knowledge required to tackle the various challenges they deal with on a daily basis and will have an understanding of various data science solutions.</p>

<p>This book aims to be self-contained and friendly for non-technical professionals. It does not assume knowledge in data science, machine learning, and programming. A basic understanding of statistics and mathematical optimization will be beneficial but is not necessary.</p>
<p>Expertise in the main concepts of software development, project management, and DevOps will be helpful for the reader since this text draws parallels with these approaches.</p>
<p>An ideal management method for data science projects is far from complete. In fact, it will never be. A silver bullet solution to all the problems of every business in each situation does not exist. Instead of creating a rigid and complex set of managerial processes, this book gives recipes and practical advice. I hope that it will serve you as a good guide that will make your journey to the world of data science as seamless as possible.</p>

- en: Anaconda is an open source data science platform that brings the best tools
    for data science together. It is a data science stack that includes more than
    100 popular packages based on Python, Scala, and R. With the help of its package
    manager, `conda`, users can work with hundreds of packages in different languages
    and perform data preprocessing, modeling, clustering, classification, and validation
    with ease.

- en: This book will get you started with Anaconda and how you can use it to perform
    data science operations in the real world. You will start of setting up the environment
    for the Anaconda platform, Jupyter, and installing the relevant packages. You
    will then cover the basics of data science and linear algebra for performing data
    science tasks. Once you are ready to go, you will start with data science operations
    such as cleaning, sorting, and data classification. You will then learn how to
    perform tasks such as clustering, regression, prediction, building machine learning
    models, and optimizing them. You will also learn how to visualize data and share
    the projects.

- en: During this course, you will learn how to use different packages, using Anaconda
    to get the best results. You will learn how to efficiently use `conda` — the package,
    dependency, and environment manager for Anaconda. You will also be introduced
    to several powerful features of Anaconda, such as additional projects, project
    add-ons, shared project drives, and powerful compute nodes that are available
    in the paid version for accomplishing advanced data handling processes. You will
    learn how to build scalable and functionally efficient packages, and how to perform
    heterogeneous data exploration, distributed computing, and more. You will learn
    to discover and share packages, notebooks, and environments to increase productivity.
    You will also learn about Anaconda Accelerate, a feature that can help you to
    achieve SLAs easily and optimize computational power.

- en: 'In this book, we introduce four programming languages: R, Python, Octave, and
    Julia. There are several reasons for doing so. Firstly, all four are open source,
    which is one of the future trends. Secondly, one of the most obvious advantages
    to using the Anaconda platform is that it allows you to where we could implement
    many programs written in different languages. However, for many new readers, learning
    four languages at the same time would  be quite challenging. The best strategy
    is to focus on R and Python first. After a while, or after finishing the whole
    book, learn Octave or Julia on the second reading.'

    It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, such as Windows and

    those that offer free software. The author has published a book entitled *Financial
    Modeling using R;* you can refer to its Amazon link at [http://canisius.edu/~yany/webs/amazon2018R.shtml](http://canisius.edu/~yany/webs/amazon2018R.shtml).'

    Julia’s base library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature,
    best-of-breed, open source C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random
    number generation, signal processing, and string processing.'

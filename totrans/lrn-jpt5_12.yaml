    space for each user.

- en: The next step is shared services that are accessed by the one Jupyter implementation,
    but many users. Services need to have authentication (is this really user xyzzy?)
    and Jupyter is moving toward using OAUTH, the standard for web service authentication.

    We installed a Jupyter server that addressed the problem, and we used Docker to
    alleviate the issue as well.

    and some of the ways it currently impacts our healthcare system. In this chapter,
    we provide a sense of the latest developments in the field and what will likely
    be coming to healthcare analytics in the not-so-distant future. We'll delve into
    healthcare and the internet, specifically the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**)
    and social media applications, to see how they are playing roles in improving
    health. Next, we'll take a look at some of the new algorithms (collectively referred
    to as "deep learning") that are achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical
    prediction tasks. Finally, although this book has presented the state of healthcare
    analytics in a hopeful and optimistic fashion, there are still some considerable
    obstacles and barriers that must be overcome for healthcare analytics to disruptively
    impact our healthcare system for the better. We'll discuss those at the end of
    the book.

    of computing devices worldwide. Practically, it is an infrastructure that provides
    services to applications such as email, social networks, data storage, and communication
    (Kurose and Ross, 2013). The internet rose to prominence in the 1990s and affected
    virtually every industry in the global economy; healthcare is no exception. As
    we discussed in [Chapter 2](71c31b0a-fa9e-4b31-8b58-f563a815e338.xhtml), *Healthcare
    Foundations*, clinical data is increasingly being stored electronically on computers,
    and third parties who perform analytics with this data often receive the data
    via the internet and use the cloud to store this data. Furthermore, the results
    of the analytics are often communicated back to the healthcare organization via
    an internet technology known as an **application programming interface** (**API**)
    by which the healthcare organization sends a request for specific information
    to a server and receives that information.

    in recent years, additional types of devices have joined the fray. The IoT is
    a network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and internet connectivity,
    enabling these devices to exchange data (Dimitrov, 2016). To date, much work has
    been done with the IoT in the healthcare space, and the implications of the IoT
    for healthcare are considerable. One emerging function of the IoT is to be able
    to remotely monitor patient health (Ma et al., 2017). A prototypical example is
    provided by a group of researchers at UCLA who developed a weight, activity, and
    blood pressure patient-monitoring system for CHF called **WANDA** (Suh et al.,
    2011). Increased weight due to fluid retention, decreased activity, and uncontrolled
    blood pressure are critical markers of CHF decompensation; WANDA uses weight scales
    and blood pressure monitors to communicate measurements about the patient to the
    patient's phone via Bluetooth. The phone then sends this data to a backend database
    in the cloud, along with activity and symptom information about the patient collected
    from a phone-based app. The data can then be used to perform logistic regression
    (similar to that we discussed in [Chapter 2](71c31b0a-fa9e-4b31-8b58-f563a815e338.xhtml),
    *Healthcare Foundations* and [Chapter 7](d029d858-9c6e-4bf0-b793-87cdc4395e86.xhtml),
    *Making Predictive Models in Healthcare*) to alert a physician in case the patient
    is at risk of CHF decompensation. All of this is done privately and securely.
    This is a prime example of how one of the deadliest and most morbid chronic diseases
    can be fought using the IoT.

    include effective interdevice communication (device companies often use their

    to watch as we look toward the future.

    basic linear autoregressive model, which is similar to logistic regression except
    that the features are the influenza rates of the previous weeks and the coefficients
    are determined by least squares regression. They compared models that used only
    the CDC's published weekly rates with models that also used a Twitter influenza
    surveillance system that analyzes tweets to determine whether they are about influenza
    infections. Their study found that incorporating Twitter data helps reduce errors
    in the predicted influenza rate by 15 - 30% up to 10 weeks into the future. Similarly,
    a review study analyzing the use of social media for monitoring disease found
    that joint information from social media sites and national health statistics
    predicted outbreaks before standard outbreak surveillance systems (Charles-Smith

    is rising, placing unprecedented emotional and financial burdens on its victims'
    families (Brathwaite et al., 2016). In the afore-cited study, by Brigham Young
    University, researchers recruited 135 participants through Amazon's Mechanical
    Turk ([www.mturk.com](https://www.mturk.com/)) and asked them to complete three
    clinically validated questionnaires for assessing suicide risk. In addition, the
    researchers analyzed the tweets of each participant using a language analysis
    tool that extracts features from the text. The features largely measure the frequency
    of certain word categories including "family," "anger," and "sadness." They used
    Python and the scikit-learn library to then build models that classified each
    of these "training set" participants as suicidal or not suicidal. To test their
    model on previously unseen data, they used leave-one-out cross-validation, a procedure
    in which only one participant was used as test data, and this was repeated 135
    times. Their decision tree model obtained an accuracy of 91.9% and had a sensitivity
    of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Certainly, this is encouraging for identifying
    suicidal patients before they commit suicidal acts, although it remains to be
    seen how privacy would be preserved in such a suicide-monitoring system.

    Models – A Review*, we discussed a study by Duke University that predicted hospital
    readmissions using a variety of algorithms (Futoma et al., 2015). In the second
    part of the study, they used a deep feed-forward network (similar to the one schematically
    depicted previously) that had three hidden layers, each consisting of 200-750
    neurons depending on the specific condition. As their nonlinear activation function,
    they used the `sigmoid` function for almost all of the layers except for the output
    layer, where they used the `softmax` function (a common practice in deep learning).
    They made a model for each of the five CMS incentivized conditions (pneumonia,
    congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction,
    and total hip/knee arthroplasty) and pretrained each network with all of the observations
    pertaining to each disease (recall that there were approximately 3,000,000 observations

    ridge regression penalization, dropout, and early stopping (see Goodfellow et

    than the best non-deep learning algorithm for all of the five conditions (although
    the improvement was significant for only three of the five diseases). Their reported
    AUC is better than the previously reported AUC for the LACE and HOSPITAL readmission
    scores. Therefore, this is an example that demonstrates the promise of deep learning
    for solving complex prediction problems in healthcare, although it also highlights
    the difficulty and complexity with which such models are trained.

    sums followed by nonlinear transformations to determine what values are used in
    the next layer. While this is generally true for feed-forward networks, this does
    not have to be true for all networks; different mathematical functions can be
    used apart from weighted sums to determine the next layer's input. In a different
    type of neural network, called a CNN, a convolution operation is used to determine
    the next layer's input. Typically, convolution operations are immediately followed
    by **pooling** operations (such as **max pooling**, in which the largest value
    is chosen from a discrete area to pass on to the next layer).
  prefs: []

    sometimes has to examine very large images to look for any signs of cancerous
    tissue, which is very time-consuming and susceptible to errors. A recent study
    by Google, Inc. sought to determine whether a convolutional neural network could
    do a better job than pathologists at detecting breast cancer in lymph node tissue
    (Liu et al., 2017). For the study, slides as large as 100,000 x 100,000 pixels
    were used. The model was able to achieve an AUC between 0.965 and 0.986, while
    the pathologists achieved an AUC of 0.966\. More significantly, the model produced
    its classification virtually instantaneously, while the human pathologist took
    30 hours! This is an example of how artificial intelligence can be combined with
    human breadth and depth of knowledge to enhance cancer detection from pathology
    images. Similar types of studies can be performed on radiology scans as well.'

    is a challenge that must be overcome. Healthcare has been described as a conservative
    field, one that is slow to embrace change. For example, there was some initial
    resistance to the idea of using electronic blood pressure cuffs in hospitals.
    Also facing skepticism and resistance was the advancement of electronic medical
    records, because of concerns that it takes away from the patient-physician interaction
    and increases the time required to write notes. Analytics and machine learning
    is certainly no exception; it is simply another new, unfamiliar technology, and
    while industries such as automotive and manufacturing embraced it with little
    issue, healthcare will likely be a different story.

    learning is the fear that computers are trying to "take over" or "replace" physicians.
    Certainly, we are a long way off from having that conversation, in terms of money,
    technology, and time. The machine learning studies we have discussed in this book
    are trained in very specific tasks, and of course, they rely on human intuition
    and judgment when being trained and interpreted. More likely, successful health
    analytics and machine learning will be achieved by utilizing a team approach,
    in which human strengths (such as generalizability and breadth of knowledge) are
    combined with computing strengths (speed and computational precision) to yield
    the best possible result. Still, the concern that physicians have about being
    replaced by computers is a real possibility, however distant, and we must find
    ways for physicians and artificial intelligence to work together rather than against
    one another.

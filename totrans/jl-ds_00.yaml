    And why Julia? A high level language with large scientific community and performance
    comparable to C, it is touted as next best language for data science. Using Julia,
    we can create statistical models, highly performant machine learning systems,
    and beautiful and attractive visualizations.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml "Chapter 1. The Groundwork – Julia''s Environment"),
    *The Groundwork – Julia’s Environment*, explains how to set up the Julia’s environment
    (Command Line(REPL) and Jupyter Notebook) and explains Julia’s ecosystem, why
    Julia is special, and package management. It also gives an introduction to parallel
    processing and multiple dispatch and explains how Julia is suited for data science.'

    the need for and process of data preparation, also called data munging. Data munging
    refers to changing data from one state to other, in well-defined reversible steps.
    It is preparing data to be used for analytics and visualizations.'

    explains that statistics is the core of data science, shows that Julia provides
    various statistical functions. This chapter will give a high-level overview of
    statistics and will explain the techniques required to apply those statistical
    concepts to general problems using Julia’s statistical packages, such as Stats.jl
    and Distributions.jl.'

    *Deep Dive into Inferential Statistics*, continues statistics is the core of the
    data science and is Julia provides various statistical functions. This chapter
    will give high level overview of advance statistics and then will explain the
    techniques to apply those statistical concepts on general problems using Julia’s
    statistical packages such as Stats.jl and Distributions.jl.'

    *Making Sense of Data Using Visualization*, explains why data visualization is
    essential part of data science and how it makes communicating the results more
    effective and reaches out to larger audience. This chapter will go through the
    Vega, Asciiplot, and Gadfly packages of Julia, which are used for data visualization.'

    Machine Learning, says "A computer program is said to learn from experience E
    with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance
    at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E"* – Tom M. Mitchell.
    Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
    and enhance without being explicitly programmed. This chapter will explain that
    Julia is a high-level language with a great performance, and is nicely suited
    for machine learning. This chapter will focus on supervised machine learning algorithms
    such as Naive Bayes, regression, and decision trees.'

    Machine Learning*, explains that unsupervised learning is a little bit different
    and harder than supervised learning. The aim is to get the system to learn something
    but we don’t know what it will learn. This chapter will focus on unsupervised
    learning algorithms such as clustering.'

    Models*, explains that a group of people has the ability to take better decisions
    than a single individual, especially when each group member comes in with their
    own biases. This is also true for machine learning. This chapter will focus on
    a machine learning technique called ensemble learning, an example being random
    forest.'

    System"), *Collaborative Filtering and Recommendation System*, explains that every
    day we are confronted with decisions and choices. These can range from our clothes
    to the movies we watch or what to eat when we order online. We take decisions
    in business too. For instance, which stock should we invest in? What if decision
    making could be automated, and suitable recommendations could be given to us.
    This chapter focuses on recommendation systems and techniques such as collaborative
    filtering and association rule mining.'

    to Deep Learning*, explains that deep learning refers to a class of machine learning
    techniques that do unsupervised or supervised feature extraction and pattern analysis
    or classification by exploiting multiple layers of non-linear information processing.
    This chapter will introduce us to deep learning in Julia. Deep learning is a new
    branch of machine learning with one goal – Artificial Intelligence. We will also
    learn about Julia''s framework, Julia''s, Mocha.jl, with which we can implement
    deep learning.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard demographic is data analysts and aspiring data scientists with
    little to no grounding in the fundamentals of the Julia language, who are looking
    to explore how to conduct data science with Julia's ecosystem of packages. On
    top of this are competent Python or R users looking to leverage Julia to enhance
    the efficiency of their ability to conduct data science. A good background in
    statistics and computational mathematics is expected.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction to Jupyter</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jupyter is a tool that allows data scientists to record their complete analysis process, much in the same way other scientists use a <strong>Lab Notebook</strong> to record tests, progress, results, and conclusions.</p>
<p>The Jupyter product was originally developed as part of the IPython project. The IPython project was used to provide interactive online access to Python. Over time, it became useful to interact with other data analysis tools, such as R, in the same manner. With this split from Python, the tool grew into its current manifestation of Jupyter. IPython is still an active tool that's available for use. The name Jupyter itself is derived from the combination of Julia, Python, and R.</p>
<p>Jupyter is available as a web application from a number of places. It can also be used locally over a wide variety of installations. In this book, we will be exploring using Jupyter on a macOS and a Windows PC, as well as over the internet with other providers.</p>
<p>With Jupyter 5.0, there were significant enhancements for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell tagging</li>
<li>Customizing keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Copying and pasting cells between Notebooks</li>
<li>A more attractive default style for tables</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>First look at Jupyter</li>
<li>Installing Jupyter</li>
<li>Notebook structure</li>
<li>Notebook workflow</li>
<li>Basic Notebook operations</li>
<li>Security in Jupyter</li>
<li>Configuration options for Jupyter</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">First look at Jupyter</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Here is a sample opening page when using Jupyter (this screenshot is on a Windows machine):</p>
<div><img src="img/c1825d7f-d3fe-47ce-a3f1-2a1f8d029e0a.png" style="width:39.75em;height:18.50em;"/></div>
<p>You should get yourself acquainted with the environment. The Jupyter user interface has a number of components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product title, Jupyter, in the top left (as expected). The logo and the title name are clickable and will return you to the Jupyter Notebook home page.</li>
<li>There are three tabs which are displayed: Files, Running, and Clusters:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b4cacbe1-5ddb-47d6-9490-ae9a966470c4.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em;width:22.17em;height:12.92em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The Files tab shows the list of files in the current directory of the page (described later on in this section).</li>
<li>The Running tab presents another screen, which shows the currently running processes and Notebooks. The drop-down lists for Terminals and Notebooks are populated with their running members:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b8a3337c-f7a3-4398-8eba-4fdb089c2f32.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:17.58em;height:18.50em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The Clusters tab presents another screen which displays a list of available clusters. This topic is covered in a later chapter:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/71ef5c3e-ad6e-4674-9fbd-e18baf907e33.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:40.67em;height:8.92em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>In the top right corner of the screen, are three buttons: Upload, New (menu), and a Refresh notebook list button.</li>
<li>The Upload button is used to add files to the Notebook space. You may also just drag and drop as you would when handling files. Similarly, you can drag and drop Notebooks into specific folders as well.</li>
<li>The menu with New at the top presents a further menu of the Notebook for the different Notebook engines that have been installed (I had installed Jupyter earlier these are not default values) Javascript (Node.js), Julia 0.6.1, Python 2 (which will not be covered in this book), and Python 3. The additional Other menu items are Text File, Folder, and Terminal:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c747968b-d19a-41c9-b39c-2c21bed5b8b8.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:17.58em;height:25.00em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The Text File option is used to add a text file to the current directory. Jupyter will open a new browser window for you, running a text editor. The text entered is automatically saved and will be displayed in your Notebook files and directory display:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/8ada88a1-ab04-4887-9251-7e22b1e28369.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:47.58em;height:11.75em;"/></p>
<p>The default filename, <kbd>untitled1.txt</kbd>, is editable. Note that the filename corresponds with the title given to the Notebook.</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The Folder option creates a new folder with the name Untitled Folder. Remember that all of the file and folder names are editable:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a7ea22f8-24ee-4919-8774-b02d6e3e7342.png" style="width:20.50em;height:5.33em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The Terminals option is used to open a new Terminal (command) window. The resulting display on a Windows machine looks as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ac1e6b17-0453-43d3-99d4-591dc1e2abb9.png" style="width:42.50em;height:11.08em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The Python 3 option is used to start a new Python 3 Notebook. The interface looks like it does in the following screenshot. You have full file editing capabilities for your script, including saving as a new file. You also have a complete working IDE for your Python script:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/612e44aa-9898-479a-9593-84aca4a74938.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:41.00em;height:13.83em;"/></p>
<p>Note, like the Text File and Folder option, you have created a Python script file in your Notebook and it is running! (You can see this in the home page display of Jupyter):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Refresh notebook list button is used to update the display. It's not really necessary as the display is reactive to any changes in the underlying file structure.</li>
<li>At the top of the Files tab is a checkbox, a drop-down menu, and a Home button.</li>
<li>The checkbox is used to toggle all the checkboxes in the items list.</li>
<li>The drop-down menu presents a list of the choices available, that is, Folders, All Notebooks, Running, and Files, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/48347874-4498-47f4-9901-dd01b091b925.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:15.58em;height:18.58em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The Folders selection will select all the folders in the display and present a count of the folders in the small box.</li>
<li>The All Notebooks selection will change the count to the number of Notebooks and provide you with five options:
<ul>
<li>Duplicate (the selected Notebooks)</li>
<li>Shutdown (the selected Notebooks)</li>
<li>View (the selected Notebooks)</li>
<li>Edit (the selected Notebooks)</li>
<li>Delete (the trash can icon; the selected Notebooks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can see them in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/1289f916-7120-45a9-9b8a-6a09ec41396c.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em;width:19.17em;height:8.58em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The Running selection will select any running scripts in the display and update the count to the number selected:</li>
</ul>
<div><img src="img/322605bc-e0c8-4ca1-ada0-4d5946046b71.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li>The Files selection will select all of the files in the Notebook display and update the count accordingly.</li>
<li>The Home button brings you back to the home screen of the Notebook.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">On the left-hand side of every item is a checkbox, an icon, and the item's name:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/90507713-af57-4413-90b2-f7049c85b793.png" style="font-size: 1em;border: 1em solid black;text-align: center;width:9.83em;height:10.00em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The checkbox is used to build a set of files to operate upon.</li>
<li>The icon is indicative of the type of item. In this case, all of the items are folders.</li>
<li>The name of the item corresponds to the name of the object. In this case, the filenames are as they are when used on the disk.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing Jupyter</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jupyter requires Python to be installed (it is based on the Python language, after all). There are a couple of tools that will automate the installation of Jupyter (and optionally Python) from a GUI. In this case, we are showing you how to install Jupyter using Anaconda, which is a Python tool for distributing software.</p>
<p class="mce-root">First of all, you have to install Anaconda. It is available on Windows and macOS environments. Download the executable from <a href="https://www.continuum.io/" target="_blank">https://www.continuum.io/</a> (the company that produces Anaconda) and run it to install Anaconda. Be sure to select the version of Anaconda using Python 3.x versus Python 2.x. The software provides a regular installation setup process, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/f38b9ae8-6aa9-4f6a-985a-efdf1a1d52d6.png" style="width:39.42em;height:30.92em;"/></div>
<p>The installation process goes through the regular steps of making you agree to the distribution rights license:</p>
<div><img src="img/d4f48d78-b8a8-4e6d-bc1d-3fc9b43bf8bd.png" style="width:39.42em;height:30.58em;"/></div>
<p>The standard Windows installation allows you to decide whether all users on the machine can run the new software or not. If you are sharing a machine with different levels of users, then you can decide upon the appropriate action:</p>
<div><img src="img/3fc7da60-b9c2-4937-bdd3-3ff234b05db0.png" style="width:39.33em;height:30.67em;"/></div>
<p>After clicking on Next, it will ask for a destination for the software to reside (I almost always keep the default paths):</p>
<div><img src="img/e82dfdbf-85c7-4a9e-9938-b25cfeeaf641.png" style="width:39.58em;height:30.50em;"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Anaconda will also adjust your file paths to make Anaconda accessible at all points on your machine via the next dialog box, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/dd77ce41-d27e-414f-a6b5-6a07d99e4c4d.png" style="width:38.42em;height:30.00em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The installation will then begin. This may take a while, depending on your machine configuration and network access:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/6928b4d3-26c9-4c9c-a0e9-bc5469006fdc.png" style="width:39.25em;height:30.75em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You will eventually get to the Installation Complete screen, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/434b0b10-82cd-4589-b75f-0fe8d4234845.png" style="width:41.75em;height:32.25em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>On Windows, Anaconda takes advantage of the semi built-in aspects of the Visual Development Environment to access Windows services natively. It asks for permission to do so with the following dialog:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f37a2bf9-249c-43b7-97f1-d3c0510ffefb.png" style="width:40.92em;height:32.08em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>And now we have truly installed Jupyter:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0e47d896-ac03-45f7-af32-91dc204cfbd6.png" style="width:41.00em;height:31.92em;"/></p>
<p>Anaconda will start. Anaconda is a great wrapper program that holds the distribution for a number of tools. The tool of importance to us is Jupyter. The Anaconda display shows the available tools, whether they need to be installed, and a starting place for each.</p>
<p>You can get to Jupyter directly by using the <strong><kbd>&gt; jupyter notebook</kbd> </strong>command from a Terminal window.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If we select Jupyter from the Anaconda screen, we will start Jupyter in a new browser window:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9e1e536c-953d-4252-8a31-4d2dce4466ee.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When Jupyter is running, we can get some details on the installation by using the File | About menu, which will provide a dialog box like this one, which is showing some details on the Jupyter installation, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/2ea28149-71a2-4f35-b3ab-de702a475783.png"/></p>
<p>If you start Jupyter from the command line directly, Jupyter will open in a new browser window and you will see some of the logging entries that will display on your Terminal window, noting the progress being made in your use:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c0dcfc1e-fb8e-4b0f-a2ee-11bc392fa09d.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Note that the last line of the log is the instruction you must use to stop the server (press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em> in the command-line window where the server is running).</p>
<p>If you press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em> in that window, the Jupyter server will shut down gracefully:</p>
<pre><strong>[W 17:26:36.688 NotebookApp] 404 GET /favicon.ico (::1) 62.00ms referer=None</strong> 
<strong>[W 17:26:36.750 NotebookApp] 404 GET /favicon.ico (::1) 0.00ms referer=None</strong> 
<strong>[I 17:28:24.891 NotebookApp] Interrupted...</strong> 
<strong>[I 17:28:24.891 NotebookApp] Shutting down kernels</strong> </pre>
<p>You will notice that the Anaconda package has been installed on your application menu for further use:</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Notebook structure</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A Jupyter Notebook is fundamentally a JSON file with a number of annotations. The main parts of the Notebook are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: A data dictionary of definitions used to set up and display the Notebook</li>
<li><strong>Notebook</strong> <strong>format</strong>: Version numbers of the software used to create the Notebook (the version number is used for backward compatibility)</li>
<li><strong>List</strong> <strong>of cells</strong>: There are different types of cells for markdown (display), code (to execute), and output (of the code type cells)</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Notebook workflow</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The typical workflow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Notebook for a project or data analysis.</li>
<li>Add your analysis steps, coding, and output.</li>
<li>Surround your analysis with organizational and presentational markdown to communicate an entire story.</li>
<li>Interactive Notebooks (that include widgets and display modules) would then be used by others by modifying parameters and data to note the effects of their changes. Your markdown would present the cases that a user may want to investigate, and probable results.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Basic Notebook operations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, we will describe the different operations that you can perform on your Jupyter Notebook. Most of the operations are menu functions that will change your display accordingly.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">File operations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's walk through the basic file operations.</p>
<p>From the Files tab, we can see a list of files and folders in the current Notebook/disk folder. If we select (check) one of the files, we will see the top-left menu change:</p>
<div><img src="img/98f896b3-c172-4f4d-8d86-bd4dc9564af2.png" style="width:26.92em;height:10.67em;"/></div>
<p>We now have choices of Duplicate, Rename, and delete (the trash icon). Note that the number of files selected, 1, is displayed in the box as well.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Duplicate</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If we hit the Duplicate button, we get a confirmation prompt with the name of the file that's been selected for duplication:</p>
<div><img src="img/738cf214-e0a2-4a3f-97f5-274d0d93529a.png" style="width:36.67em;height:11.67em;"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">Cancel will close the dialog. Duplicate will create another copy of the file with an appended copy number, as shown in the following screenshot. The original filename has been used with the addition of <kbd>-Copyn</kbd> in the filename, where n is the copy number. Note the original file extension, <kbd>.py</kbd>, has been maintained in the new file:</p>
<div><img src="img/d66d4a64-deae-4a68-9e24-94d6c7a5e139.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Rename</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Similarly, if we hit the Rename button, another dialog box will appear to prompt the new filename to apply. The main filename has been highlighted as it assumes you want to maintain the file extension as the file type has not changed:</p>
<div><img src="img/2c5cd430-97b3-483c-aeef-f551d6081ebf.png" style="width:26.25em;height:15.42em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Delete</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We can also delete the file by clicking on the trashcan icon. This brings up a confirmation dialog box as follows. I like that they changed the background of Delete to red to make sure that you don't just happily click it:</p>
<div><img src="img/4d0578e1-f929-4d23-8629-4365b84a0d6f.png" style="width:39.33em;height:11.33em;"/></div>
<p>At the top right of the screen, we have options for Upload and New.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Upload</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Upload button is more meaningful when the Notebook is stored on a web server. When running it on your desktop, it allows you to move files easily from one part of your Notebook to another. If you click this button, you are presented with a file selector dialog box. The following screenshot is specific to a Windows environment, but a similar display is presented on macOS. Once you select a file, it will be added to your Notebook space:</p>
<div><img src="img/5fa266bd-a133-4a44-8a8e-83c2ff472304.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">New text file</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If we opt to create a Text File, we are presented with a new browser panel in the Jupyter text editor (I have shrunk down the size of the screen so that the display fits the boundaries of this book):</p>
<div><img src="img/5dc6af18-d34f-444f-87ee-ed87ff214ae9.png"/></div>
<p>There are several points of interest on this screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are in a new browser panel (the Notebook display is still present in the Other tab).</li>
<li>The name of the new file is <kbd>untitled1.txt</kbd>. Using the same convention as duplication, the new filename starts with <kbd>untitled.txt</kbd> and is incremented as needed.</li>
<li>Curiously, it mentions when the file was created.</li>
<li>In the top-right corner, we see Plain Text. So, we might expect to see some other description here for other file types.</li>
<li>We have a new menu, which includes File, Edit, View, and Language.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The File menu has the following options:
<ul>
<li>New: Starts another new text window.</li>
<li>Save: Save or updates the current text file into the Notebook area.</li>
<li>Rename: Changes the name of the file (unlikely, as you would want to keep the <kbd>untitledn</kbd> name that's provided).</li>
<li>Download: Again, an option that makes more sense if your Notebook is running on the web. As explained for upload, download on a desktop installation allows you to copy a file to another part of your machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li>The Edit menu has the following options:
<ul>
<li>Find: Searches for a string.</li>
<li>Find &amp; Replace: Searches and replaces a string.</li>
<li>Separator: Below this line is adjusting the text editor in use.</li>
<li>Key Map: Set your own function mapping for your keyboard.</li>
<li>Default: Checked as it is the default choice. This means using the default text editor.</li>
<li>Sublime Text: If you would prefer to use the Sublime editor.</li>
<li>Vim: If you would prefer to use VIM.</li>
<li>emacs: If you would prefer to use emacs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The View menu only has an option to Toggle Line Numbers. I imagine future revisions of the package will have additional features. Similarly, for other file types, the menu may change.</li>
<li>The Language menu allows you to specify whether this text file is a specific type of programming file. This allows for syntax highlighting, which is a major feature of source editors. The list is extensive:</li>

<div><img src="img/fa52e60d-ad02-4868-afbb-9c78912febc0.png" style="width:16.83em;height:22.50em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">New folder</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Folder option creates a new folder with the naming convention <kbd>untitled</kbd> folder.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">New Python 3</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The new Python 3 option creates a new Python 3 Notebook. You are presented with a new browser panel with a similar naming convention, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p>This is a very different presentation, where Python code is expected to be entered in the cells on the page with results displayed in each cell.</p>
<p>There is an extensive menu with File, Edit, View, Insert, Cell, Kernel, and Help options. We have a fairly complete <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>) for creating Python coding:</p>
<div><img src="img/12f7bbc0-f6dc-4dee-85f9-54cd1360d06c.png"/></div>
<p>The File menu has the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Notebook: Starts a new Notebook (another browser panel like this one)</li>
<li>Open...: Selects a file to open from the Notebook files view</li>
<li>Make a Copy...: Copies the current Notebook completely into another browser panel</li>
<li>Rename...: Renames the current Notebook</li>
<li>Save and Checkpoint: Saves the current Notebook and records a checkpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>A checkpoint is a point in time where all information about a Notebook is preserved. You can have many checkpoints and return the state of your Notebook to the previous checkpoint state at any time. This is an excellent way to give yourself the room to try out a new angle on your analysis without risking losing what you have done so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revert to Checkpoint: Reverts your Notebook to a previous checkpoint</li>
<li>Print Preview: Presents a preview of the printed form of your Notebook</li>
<li>Download as: Downloads the Notebook in a variety of formats:
<ul>
<li>IPython Notebook (its current form)</li>
<li>IPython</li>
<li>HTML representation</li>
<li>Markdown a specialized display format</li>
<li>REST – Restructured Text, which is an easy to read, plain text markup</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>Presentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Close and Halt: Closes the current Notebook and stops any running scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the rectangular work areas in your Notebook is a cell. The innermost text area is where you enter code. Below that (but within the surrounding rectangle), the results of each code stop will be displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Edit menu has the following options:
<ul>
<li>Copy Cells: Copies cells from the clipboard to the current cursor position.</li>
<li>Paste Cells Above: Pastes cells from the clipboard above the current cell.</li>
<li>Paste Cells Below: Pastes cells from the clipboard below the current cell.</li>
<li>Paste Cells &amp; Replace: Pastes the cells from the clipboard on top of the current cell.</li>
<li>Delete Cells: Deletes the current cells.</li>
<li>Undo Delete Cells: Reverts the last delete cells invocation.</li>
<li>Split Cell: Splits up a cell from the current cursor position.</li>
<li>Merge Cell Above: Merges the current cell with the one above.</li>
<li>Merge Cell Below: Merges the current cell with the one below.</li>
<li>Edit Notebook Metadata: Every Notebook has underlying metadata which describes the characteristics of the Notebook. Advanced users can manipulate this data directly in order to adjust features more readily. For example, the current Notebook metadata looks like the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Security in Jupyter</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jupyter Notebooks are created in order to be shared with other users, in many cases over the internet. However, Jupyter Notebooks can execute arbitrary code and generate arbitrary code. This can be a problem if malicious aspects have been placed in a Notebook. The default security mechanisms for Jupyter Notebooks include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw HTML is always sanitized (checked for malicious coding). Further information can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/caja">https://developers.google.com/caja</a>.</li>
<li>You cannot run external JavaScript.</li>
<li>Cell contents (especially HTML and JavaScript) is not trusted (requires user validation to continue).</li>
<li>The output from any cell is not trusted.</li>
<li>All other HTML or JavaScript is never trusted, and clearing the output will cause the Notebook to become trusted when saved.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Security digest</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Notebooks can also use a security digest to ensure the correct user is modifying the contents. A digest takes into account the entire contents of the Notebook and a secret (only known by the Notebook creator). This combination ensures that malicious coding is not going to be added to a Notebook.</p>
<p>You can add a security digest to a Notebook by using the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>~/.jupyter/profile_default/security/notebook_secret</strong> </pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here, you replace the <kbd>notebook_secret</kbd> part with your secret.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Trust options</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You can specifically apply your trust to a Notebook by using the following command-line option:</p>
<pre><strong>jupyter trust /path/to/notebook.ipynb</strong> </pre>
<p>Or you can do it once the Notebook is opened by the File | Trusted Notebook menu option.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Configuration options for Jupyter</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You can configure some of the display parameters that are used when presenting Notebooks. These are configurable due to the use of a product (<strong>CodeMirror</strong>) to present and modify the Notebook. CodeMirror is a JavaScript-based editor for use within web pages (Notebooks).</p>
<p>The list of configurable options is still in development. Some of the options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line-separator: The character used to separate text lines</li>
<li>Theme: The overall theme of presentation used in the Notebook</li>
<li>Indent-unit: How many spaces to indent blocks of coding</li>
</ul>
<p>To change the configuration of one of the options, you can open the JavaScript window of your browser, enter the coding to modify an option, and then load your Notebook. Then, the modifications you make will be applied to the Notebook presentation. There is further documentation on this, which is available at <a href="https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#option_indentUnit.">https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#option_indentUnit.</a></p>
<p>For example, to change the indentation (Indent-unit) for your Notebook, you would use the following JavaScript:</p>
<pre>var mycell = Jupyter.notebook.get_selected_cell(); 
var cell_config = mycell.config; 
var code_patch = { 
      CodeCell:{ 
        cm_config:{indentUnit:2} 
      } 
    } 
cell_config.update(code_patch) </pre>
<p>You have now seen all of the standard operations that are available to you in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we investigated the various user interface elements that are available in a Notebook. We learned how to install the software on a macOS or a Microsoft PC. We were exposed to the Notebook structure. We saw the typical workflow that's used when developing a Notebook, and we walked through the user interface operations that are available in a Notebook. Lastly, we saw some of the configuration options that are available to advanced users for their Notebook.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn all about Python scripting in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

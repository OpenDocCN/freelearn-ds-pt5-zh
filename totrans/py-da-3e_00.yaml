- en: Data analysis enables you to generate value from small and big data by discovering
    new patterns and trends, and Python is one of the most popular tools for analyzing
    a wide variety of data. With this book, you'll get up and running with using Python
    for data analysis by exploring the different phases and methodologies used in
    data analysis, and you'll learn how to use modern libraries from the Python ecosystem
    to create efficient data pipelines.

- en: Starting with the essential statistical and data analysis fundamentals using
    Python, you'll perform complex data analysis and modeling, data manipulation,
    data cleaning, and data visualization using easy-to-follow examples. You'll then
    learn how to conduct time series analysis and signal processing using ARMA models.
    As you advance, you'll get to grips with smart processing and data analytics using
    machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, **Principal Component
    Analysis** (**PCA**), and clustering. In the concluding chapters, you'll work
    on real-world examples to analyze textual and image data using **natural language
    processing** (**NLP**) and image analytics techniques, respectively. Finally,
    the book will demonstrate parallel computing using Dask.

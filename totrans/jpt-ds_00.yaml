- en: Jupyter is an open platform that is growing in use. Jupyter can have programs
    written in a variety of languages. Many of these languages are geared towards
    data science, such as R and Python. In this book, we'll look at solving data science
    problems using a variety of languages on the Jupyter platform.

    Jupyter as the platform for our data analysis and visualizations. We'll look into
    data mining, data wrangling, and machine learning, all under the auspices of the
    Jupyter framework.

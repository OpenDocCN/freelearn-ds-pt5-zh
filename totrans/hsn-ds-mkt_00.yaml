- en: The adoption of data science and machine learning for marketing has been on
    the rise, from small to large organizations. With data science, you can better
    understand the drivers behind the successes and failures of previous marketing
    strategies and you can better understand customer behavior and interaction with
    your products. With data science, you can also predict customer behavior and create
    better targeted and personalized marketing strategies for better cost per acquisition,
    higher conversion rates, and higher net sales. With this book, you will be able
    to apply various data science techniques to create data-driven marketing strategies.

- en: This book serves as a practical guide to performing simple-to-advanced tasks
    in marketing. You will use data science to understand what drives sales and customer
    engagement. You will use machine learning to forecast which customer is likely
    to engage with products more and has the highest expected lifetime value. You
    will also use machine learning to understand what data tells you about different
    customer segments and recommend the right products for individual customers that
    they are most likely to purchase. By the end of this book, you will be well-versed
    with various data science and machine learning techniques and how they can be
    utilized for different marketing goals.

- en: Personally, I would have benefited from books such as this. When I was embarking
    on my career in data science and marketing, there were abundant resources on theories
    and details of different data science and machine learning techniques, but not
    so much on how to use these technologies and techniques for marketing specifically.
    Learning about the theories was vastly different from actually utilizing and applying
    them to real-world business use cases in marketing. In this book, I hope to share
    my experience and the knowledge acquired through significant instances of trial
    and error in applying data science and machine learning to different marketing
    goals. By the end of this book, you will have a good understanding of what types
    of technologies and techniques are used for different marketing use cases, where
    to find additional resources, and what to study next after this book.

    exercises. As you may already be aware, Python and R are two of the most frequently
    used programming languages for data scientists, data analysts, and machine learning
    engineers on account of their ease of use, the abundant resources that are available
    in relation to data science and machine learning, and the broad community of users.
    In each chapter, we will guide you through the different packages and libraries
    used and how to install them, so you do not need to worry about what to install
    on your computer before you start this book.

- en: To get the most out of this book, I highly recommend that you work through the
    programming exercises in each chapter thoroughly. Each exercise is meant to lay
    a solid foundation for more advanced exercises, so it is critical that you follow
    each and every step in the programming exercises. I also recommend you be adventurous.
    Different technologies and techniques discussed in each chapter can be mixed with
    those from other chapters. A technique used in one chapter is not meant to be
    exclusively applicable to that specific chapter. You can apply the technology
    and techniques learned from one chapter to other chapters, so it will be beneficial
    for you to go through the examples from the beginning again and try to mix up
    different techniques learned from other chapters when you finish this book.

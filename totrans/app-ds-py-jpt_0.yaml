- en: Applied Data Science with Python and Jupyter teaches you the skills you need
    for entry-level data science. You'll learn about some of the most commonly used
    libraries that are part of the Anaconda distribution, and then explore machine
    learning models with real datasets to give you the skills and exposure you need
    for the real world. You'll finish up by learning how easy it can be to scrape
    and gather your own data from the open web so that you can apply your new skills
    in an actionable context.

- en: Alex Galea has been doing data analysis professionally since graduating with
    a master's in physics from the University of Guelph in Canada. He developed a
    keen interest in Python while researching quantum gases as part of his graduate
    studies. More recently, Alex has been doing web data analytics, where Python continues
    to play a large part in his work. He frequently blogs about work and personal
    projects, which are generally data-centric and usually involve Python and Jupyter
    Notebooks.

<p class="mce-root">The functional aim of this book is to demonstrate how Python packages are used for data analysis; how to import, collect, clean, and refine data from <strong>Electronic Health Record</strong> (<strong>EHR</strong>) surveys; and how to make predictive models with this data, with the help of real-world examples.</p>

<p><em>Healthcare Analytics Made Simple</em> is for you if you are a developer who has a working knowledge of Python or a related programming language, even if you are new to healthcare or predictive modeling with healthcare data. Clinicians interested in analytics and healthcare computing will also benefit from this book. This book can also serve as a textbook for students enrolled on an introductory course on machine learning for healthcare.</p>

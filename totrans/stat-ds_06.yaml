    clear explanation of what statistical regression is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For starters, statistical regression is also routinely referred to as regression
    analysis and is a process for estimating the relationships among variables**.**
    This process encompasses numerous techniques for modeling and analyzing variables,
    focusing on the relationship between a dependent variable and one (or more) independent
    variables (or **predictors****).**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So specifically, regression analysis is the work done to identify and understand
    how the (best representative) value of a dependent variable (a variable that **depends**
    on other factors) changes when any one of the independent variables (a variable
    that **stands alone** and isn't changed by the other variables) is changed while
    the other independent variables stay the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A simple example might be how the total dollars spent on marketing (an independent
    variable example) impacts the total sales dollars (a dependent variable example)
    over a period of time (is it really as simple as more marketing equates to higher
    sales?), or perhaps there is a correlation between the total marketing dollars
    spent (independent variable), discounting a products price (another independent
    variable), and the amount of sales (a dependent variable)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind this key point that regression analysis is used to understand which
    among the independent variables are related to the dependent variable(s), not
    just the relationship of these variables. Also, the inference of causal relationships
    (between the independent and dependent variables) is an important objective. However,
    this can lead to illusions or false relationships, so caution is recommended!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, regression analysis can be thought of as estimating the conditional
    expectations of the value of the dependent variable, given the independent variables
    being observed, that is, endeavoring to predict the average value of the dependent
    variable when the independent variables are set to certain values. I call this
    the lever affect—meaning when one increases or decreases a value of one component,
    it directly affects the value at least one other (variable).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An alternate objective of the process of regression analysis is the establishment
    of location parameters or the quantile of a distribution. In other words, this
    idea is to determine values that may be a cutoff, dividing a range of a probability
    distribution values.

    helpful in presenting the overall management approach to data science projects.
    Data science management is a multidimensional topic that requires a manager to
    show technical, organizational, and strategic proficiency so that they can execute
    a data science strategy inside any organization.

    as well as its technical limitations. Without an understanding of the basic concepts,
    it is extremely easy to misunderstand your colleagues or provide over-promising
    project results to the customer. The *What is Data Science* section of this book
    described the basics of machine learning and deep learning, including explanations
    behind the mathematical concepts that comprise machine learning algorithms. We
    explored the world of technology and business metrics, defined mathematical optimization,
    and looked into statistics and probability. These concepts helped us define how
    machines learn using maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we can explain
    almost every machine learning algorithm using this mathematical framework. We
    have also seen that there is no silver bullet in the machine learning world thanks
    to the no free lunch theorem. This theorem states that no machine learning algorithm
    will be better than random choice if you measure its accuracy over all possible
    datasets and tasks.

    section, where we learned about balancing long-term and short-term team building
    goals. We talked about the flaws of over-complicated technical interviews and
    how to avoid them. The main idea here was to look at what you need and then search
    for people with specific skill sets, rather than a rockstar data scientist who
    can do anything. We also discussed how to conduct data science interviews using
    real-world experience. Then, we explored the concept of team balance, which forms
    the long-term stability of teams that allows them to grow and develop. We also
    touched on the important topic of the growth mindset. By following this practice
    yourself, you become an example to your team.

    starting from a bird's-eye strategic view on innovations and marketing. We drew
    connections between innovations and data science and provided high-level strategies
    for managing innovations in different kinds of organizations. We have looked at
    data science project management on a lower scale and examined processes that we
    can use to manage individual projects. Then, we defined the data science project
    life cycle based on CRISP-DM and looked over common mistakes that customers, managers,
    and implementation teams make when delivering data science solutions. We also
    touched on the topic of software component reusability and stated that creating
    reusable components will ease the development of your projects and increase your
    team's business potential.

    on engineering aspects of data science projects. We discussed how to create a
    technology stack based on customer requirements and your own core technological
    expertise. Finally, we saw how to create comparison matrices in order to choose
    between different technologies.

- en: Congratulations on finishing this book! I hope that it helped you deepen your
    knowledge of data science and systemize management techniques for data science
    projects. Please don't leave what you have read about the theory of data science
    behind. To master the concepts we have covered in this book, you should apply
    them to your daily work. I also strongly advise you to acquire a growth mindset,
    if you haven't already. You will be amazed by how far you can go by learning something
    new each day, even if it's the smallest bit of knowledge. No book can fully cover
    every aspect of data science management, but you can continue this journey by
    referring to one of the books mentioned in this chapter or discovering your own
    path while mastering data science.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"/>About the Book</h2>
			<p>Applied Data Science with Python and Jupyter teaches you the skills you need for entry-level data science. You'll learn about some of the most commonly used libraries that are part of the Anaconda distribution, and then explore machine learning models with real datasets to give you the skills and exposure you need for the real world. You'll finish up by learning how easy it can be to scrape and gather your own data from the open web so that you can apply your new skills in an actionable context.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"/>About the Author</h3>
			<p>Alex Galea has been doing data analysis professionally since graduating with a master's in physics from the University of Guelph in Canada. He developed a keen interest in Python while researching quantum gases as part of his graduate studies. More recently, Alex has been doing web data analytics, where Python continues to play a large part in his work. He frequently blogs about work and personal projects, which are generally data-centric and usually involve Python and Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Objectives</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Get up and running with the Jupyter ecosystem</li>
				<li>Identify potential areas of investigation and perform exploratory data analysis</li>
				<li>Plan a machine learning classification strategy and train classification models</li>
				<li>Use validation curves and dimensionality reduction to tune and enhance your models</li>
				<li>Scrape tabular data from web pages and transform it into Pandas DataFrames</li>
				<li>Create interactive, web-friendly visualizations to clearly communicate your findings</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Audience</h3>
			<p>Applied Data Science with Python and Jupyter is ideal for professionals with a variety of job descriptions across a large range of industries, given the rising popularity and accessibility of data science. You'll need some prior experience with Python, with any prior work with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Pandas providing you a useful head start.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Approach</h3>
			<p>Applied Data Science with Python and Jupyter covers every aspect of the standard data workflow process with a perfect blend of theory, practical hands-on coding, and relatable illustrations. Each module is designed to build on the learnings of the previous chapter. The book contains multiple activities that use real-life business scenarios for you to practice and apply your new skills in a highly relevant context.</p>

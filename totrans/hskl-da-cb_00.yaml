- en: Data analysis is something that many of us have done before, maybe even without
    knowing it. It is the essential art of gathering and examining pieces of information
    to suit a variety of purposes—from visual inspection to machine learning techniques.
    Through data analysis, we can harness the meaning from information littered all
    around the digital realm. It enables us to resolve the most peculiar inquiries,
    perhaps even summoning new ones in the process.

- en: Haskell acts as our conduit for robust data analysis. For some, Haskell is a
    programming language reserved to the most elite researchers in academia and industry.
    Yet, we see it charming one of the fastest growing cultures of open source developers
    around the world. The growth of Haskell is a sign that people are uncovering its
    magnificent functional pureness, resilient type safety, and remarkable expressiveness.
    Flip the pages of this book to see it all in action.

- en: '*Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook* is more than just a fusion of two entrancing
    topics in computing. It is also a learning tool for the Haskell programming language
    and an introduction to simple data analysis practices. Use it as a Swiss Army
    Knife of algorithms and code snippets. Try a recipe a day, like a kata for your
    mind. Breeze through the book for creative inspiration from catalytic examples.
    Also, most importantly, dive deep into the province of data analysis in Haskell.'

<p class="calibre4">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: In statistics, a <kbd class="calibre22">boxplot</kbd> is a simple way to gain information regarding the shape, variability, and center (or median) of a statistical data set, so we'll use the <kbd class="calibre22">boxplot</kbd> with our data to see if we can identify both the median <kbd class="calibre22">Coin-in</kbd> and if there are any outliers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="calibre29">MyFile &lt;-"C:/GammingData/SlotsResults.csv" 
MyData &lt;- read.csv(file=MyFile, header=TRUE, sep=",") </pre>
<p class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre7">New terms</strong> and <strong class="calibre7">important words</strong> are shown in bold. </p>

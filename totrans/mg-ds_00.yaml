- en: Data science and machine learning can transform any organization and open new
    opportunities. Any data science project is a unique mix of research, software
    engineering, and business expertise. A substantial managerial effort is needed
    to guide the solution from prototype development to production. Traditional approaches
    often fail as they have different conditions and requirements in mind. This book
    presents a proven approach to data science project management, with tips and best
    practices to guide you along the way.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book aims to be self-contained and friendly for non-technical professionals.
    It does not assume knowledge in data science, machine learning, and programming.
    A basic understanding of statistics and mathematical optimization will be beneficial
    but is not necessary.

- en: An ideal management method for data science projects is far from complete. In
    fact, it will never be. A silver bullet solution to all the problems of every
    business in each situation does not exist. Instead of creating a rigid and complex
    set of managerial processes, this book gives recipes and practical advice. I hope
    that it will serve you as a good guide that will make your journey to the world
    of data science as seamless as possible.

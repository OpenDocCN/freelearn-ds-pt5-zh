<p>In this chapter, we will learn about the three key aspects of building a successful team and explain the role of a leader in a data science team. We will learn how to build and sustain a balanced team that's capable of delivering end-to-end solutions. Then, we will set out a plan that we will improve and add several useful management skills to our arsenal: leadership by example, active listening, empathy and emotional quotient, trust, and delegation. We will also consider how advocating a growth mindset can be a major part of the team development process.<br/></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieving team Zen</li>
<li>Leadership and people management</li>
<li>Facilitating a growth mindset</li>
</ul>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Achieving team Zen</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A balanced team solves all incoming tasks efficiently and effortlessly. Each team member complements others and helps others to find a solution with their unique capabilities. However, balanced teams do not just magically come into existence when a skillful leader assembles their elite squad. Finding team Zen is not a momentary achievement; you need to work to find it. It may seem that some teams are stellar performers while others are underwhelming. It is crucial to realize that team performance is not a constant state. The best teams can become the worst, and vice versa. Each team should work to improve. Some teams may need less work, while others will be harder to change, but no team is hopeless. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>But what makes a balanced team? Each team member is unique in their soft and hard skill sets. Some people are a universal jack of all trades, while others are highly specialized in a single area of expertise. Also, we all have vast emotional differences. In a balanced team, everyone complements and augments each other. Each team member knows at what point they can participate to yield the best results. Balanced teams are self-organizing. They can efficiently plan and act without direct interventions from the team leader. The leader unites the team and makes it coherent, but the actual work process of a balanced team looks highly decentralized. The leader frequently takes part in teamwork and helps everyone reach a common goal. The team members have good relationships and want to advance themselves to new heights. Another feature of balanced teams is that they do not have a single point of failure. If someone is ill or has decided to move on, it is not a big deal regarding how the core team functions.</p>
<p>Unbalanced teams can be hard to distinguish at first glance. An unbalanced team can function properly and even be a top performer, but unbalanced teams can be very efficient but fragile. People do not stick around long in an unbalanced team because it is hard to do so. Unbalanced teams have many forms, so they are hard to define. Here are two examples of an unbalanced team: </p>
<ul>
<li>In the first case, the team leader is the best expert in the team. They do most of the important work, while other team members work on the simplest delegated tasks. The team leader decomposes the task into many simple subtasks and assigns them to their team. No one sees the whole picture but them. The unwillingness to share important parts of the work and to involve the team in the task's decomposition process creates a strong imbalance. The team is very fragile and will not function properly without its leader. Employees in this team burn out quickly because they do not see the result of their work. Most of the tasks are boring and repetitive, so they seek challenges in another team, project, or company. This is a case of expertise imbalance in a team.</li>
<li>In the second case, the team is building a very large project. The development has been going on for 3 years. The team leader and several data scientists who were working on the project from the start developed strong relationships and a team culture. However, not all of the team members stayed with them for the whole 3 years, so the team leader found several new experts eager to take on the project. However, these new team members found it hard to assimilate into the team. The <strong>core team </strong>unwillingly communicates with the <strong>new team</strong>. They find it hard to do so because of the cultural gap. It is a lot easier to interact with familiar people than with the <strong>new team</strong>. Thus, cultural imbalance has emerged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imbalance in teams is very hard to fight once it has sprung its roots. Each specific case needs careful examination and a plan to bring the team to a more balanced state. The best way to fight imbalance is to avoid it in the first place.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Just like when you're hiring staff to build a balanced team, you should look toward your goal. Without a goal, there is no reason for action, no balance, and no imbalance. For example, your goal could be <em>delivering solutions for problems using data science with a short time to market</em>. From this goal, the main characteristics of your team will arise. To successfully apply data science, you will need experts in the field. To do this with a short time to market, you will need good internal processes so that everyone works smoothly and reliably. The team will need to improve over time, and it will need to grow and last; this is the need for balance.</p>
<p>State your goals clearly and ensure all team members understand them so that everyone is on the same page about the definition of success. It would be impossible to train machine learning algorithms with no metrics and loss functions. Without feedback, humans stop developing too. When there is no notion of good and bad, we stagnate, and goals help us define these contrasts.</p>
<p>Another important component of each team is its roles. Roles define sets of activities that team members can perform. You may think you do not need roles because your team is agile and cross-functional, so everyone can and should be able to do everything. This may be crucial for small teams to survive while being adroit at what they do. But being cross-functional does not contradict having clearly defined roles. In fact, cross-functionality and size are different dimensions of a team, with the latter affecting the former through the number of roles each team member is performing. </p>
<p>For example, our data science team should handle everything from the definition of business requirements to the delivery of the final solution. We have loosely defined the project delivery process and assigned each stage to a role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining business requirements</strong>: Business analyst</li>
<li><strong>Defining functional requirements</strong>: System analyst</li>
<li><strong>Defining nonfunctional requirements</strong>: System analyst</li>
<li><strong>Discovering and documenting incoming data sources, creating data marts, and reports</strong>: Data analyst</li>
<li><strong>Exploratory data analysis and modeling</strong>: Data scientist</li>
<li><strong>Building software around the model</strong>: Software engineer</li>
<li><strong>Creating documentation for the final product</strong>: Software engineer and systems analyst</li>
<li><strong>Delivery and deployment</strong>: DevOps engineer and software engineer</li>
<li><strong>Management and team leadership</strong>: Team leader</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Suppose that this team is limited to only three members, including the team leader. We can combine several roles into one to fulfill the team size constraint, while simultaneously creating goals for individual team members. Recall that forming goals for each position is the foundation of a good hiring process, and creating a team goal, defining roles, and mapping them to positions is a prerequisite for that.</p>
<p>For our example, there are many options, but the most realistic would be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining business, functional, and nonfunctional requirements</strong>: Analyst</li>
<li><strong>Delivering software and models</strong>: Machine learning engineer</li>
<li><strong>Project management, team leadership, and the acceptance of final and intermediate results</strong>: Team leader</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating individual goals that are aligned with team goals can be done through the following set of transformations:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Team goal → Team roles → Positions → Individual goals</p>
<p>The more roles your team has, and the smaller its size, the vaguer the boundaries between the team members will be, and the harder it will be to find teammates to fill in those roles. Defining roles helps you to be realistic regarding the amount of work and the budget it will take you to create a good team, so never leave this step out. Mapping roles to positions is equally helpful if your team is large and the responsibilities of every employee are clearly isolated or if your team is small and responsibilities are less segregated. </p>
<p>By following this process, you can create a feedback system that will optimize not only global team goals but also individual goals, providing everyone with an understanding of what their part in the big picture is. When designing deep neural networks, you need to create a loss function and make sure that the gradient passes through each layer. When building teams, you need to make sure that feedback passes through each part of your team, starting from yourself.</p>
<p>Understanding roles, goals, and size constraints will also help you grow and develop your team. Over time, your team will grow, but if you maintain the core goal-role-position framework, adding new responsibilities and team members will be straightforward with growth, and you will assign positions to fewer roles. Goal-position-role maintenance and revision is also necessary to keep your team balanced. Changes in organizational structure or in the main goals of a team always bring a risk of creating an imbalance, so be careful when introducing changes and plan ahead.</p>
<p>The concepts of team balance and a feedback system are simple but powerful tools that will help you build a balanced team and scale it in the right way.</p>

    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Leadership and people management</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the <em>Achieving the team Zen</em> section, we concluded that a team leader should not be at the core of the team because this situation leads to severe organizational imbalance. Nonetheless, a team leader should be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. A team leader should facilitate team functioning, help every team member take part in the process, and mitigate any risks that threaten to disrupt the team functions before they become real issues. A good team leader can substitute and provide support for all or most of the roles in their team. They should have good expertise regarding the core roles of the team so that they can be helpful in as many of the team activities as possible.</p>
<p>The team leader should make sure that information propagates through the team effortlessly, and that all communication takes place as needed. If we take the internet as an analogy, the team leader should provide a fast and reliable communication network for all the servers.</p>
<p>Another important activity for a team leader is expanding the team constantly and in a balanced manner. All team members should have sufficient motivation, be challenged, and have a clear understanding of how they can grow according to their individual goals.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a team leader should set goals and achieve those goals together with their team. The team leader should unify everyone's efforts into a single focal point and make sure that focal point is the right one.</p>
<p>But how can we keep everyone focused on their efforts? If you were to ask me about the one most important aspect of leadership, I would say it is leadership by example. The modern idea of a successful leader can rarely be allowed in the real world. Many imagine that all leaders are highly skilled communicators and negotiators who can persuade anyone to do anything with the power of words. Of course, communication skills are important, but not those of a manipulative kind. Skilled manipulators could have an edge in some situations, but each action has consequences—and manipulation is always destructive in the long run.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Leading by example</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The most simple and effective leadership advice was likely given to you in childhood: if you want to have good relationships with others, take the first step. Want people to trust you? Build incrementally by trusting other people. Want your team to be motivated? Be involved in the workflow and give everyone a helping hand; show them progress. Management literature calls this principle leadership by example. Walk your talk, and everyone will follow the example.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This kind of leadership is very effective for team building: </p>
<ul>
<li>It does not require you to learn and apply complex theoretical methodologies</li>
<li>It builds relationships and trust in your team</li>
<li>It ensures that the team leader is involved in the workflow of every role in the team</li>
<li>It helps everyone grow professionally, including yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>The only downside of leadership by example is that it can be hard. It requires you to be deeply involved in your team—emotionally and intellectually—and this can be debilitating. It is important to avoid exhaustion because your team will feel it instantly. If you burn out, so will everyone on your team. Thankfully, there is a simple way to avoid leadership burnout. Make sure that you have time during your workday that allows you to take a rest from team leadership activities. Maybe it is a small research project that will help your team members or maybe it is a prototype you can handle yourself.</p>
<p>Another caveat is that leadership by example can be hard to let go of. Many aspiring team leaders take too much work on themselves. The leader is often the most experienced professional on the team, and delegating work may be emotionally hard, especially when you know that you can do it yourself. A team cannot function without task delegation, so such teams fall apart quickly. Imbalance appears when the team leader cannot delegate tasks properly, and from thereon it builds upon itself.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Using situational leadership</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Thankfully, in most cases, problems regarding task delegation are mostly emotional. To delegate without fear, you should build trust. And to build trust, you need to take the first step. If you find it hard to delegate, just force yourself to try it. It may seem like a leap of faith, but jump and see what your team is capable of. At first, you may be scared, but I assure you, they will surprise you. The tricky part of delegation is the task description step. Delegation will cause failure if you cannot describe what needs to be done correctly and without over-complicating the matter. To delegate effectively, you can make use of situational leadership. At its core, it is a very simple concept: you must measure your teammate's competence and commitment levels. Then, you need to choose your leadership style according to those levels.</p>
<p>The following diagram represents a simple and useful tool for choosing a leadership style for task delegation:</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a787552e-04d7-46bf-8a88-f9c29402cea3.png" style="width:38.17em;height:52.08em;" width="1445" height="1970"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The preceding diagram measures employees' readiness by two variables: commitment and competence levels. Commitment stands for the employee's level of motivation. People with high commitment levels find their work interesting and are ready to try hard until the task is completed. A low commitment level, on the other hand, indicates that the person is not very interested in completing a task, finds it boring or repetitive, or is close to burning out. The other side of the coin is competence, which indicates the employee's ability to handle tasks by themselves. Low competence indicates that the person has no or low prior experience in the area, regarding the task they need to complete. A high competency level indicates that the employee has all the necessary knowledge and experience to complete the task. Situational leadership helps you keep motivation levels stable while ensuring that the employee gets all the necessary instructions so that their competence can grow without harming the task's resulting quality.</p>
<p>The following example shows how we can apply the situational leadership technique by determining an employee's competence and commitment before delegating a task:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine that you've got a new team member, Jane. She does not have much experience and is taking a junior position in your team. Her motivation is high, and she is eager to learn new things. Here, the commitment level is high and the competence level is low, so we must take a directive leadership style. Obviously, she cannot solve complex tasks alone. It is better to take something simple, split the task into as many subtasks as you can, thoroughly describe everything, and check the correctness of every step. Employees from this category will take up a lot of your time, so be aware of your own resources. A team of 10 high-commitment-low-competency people can easily siphon all of your time.</li>
<li>Over some time, Jane has gained some skills, but her motivation has started to fall recently. This is the perfect time to coach. At this stage, you want to loosen control a bit to allow your teammate to make commitments.</li>
<li>Jane's competency levels have grown further, and you can tell that she has somewhere between a moderate to a high level of technical skill compared to others in your team. It is important to catch this transition because Jane's motivation is at risk again. To keep it up, you will want to change your leadership style to one that's supportive and focuses less on particular assignments. You will also want to share decision-making tasks with her. Jane's performance will probably be inconsistent at this stage, so provide any support she needs and help her transition into the last stage.</li>
<li>At this stage, Jane is already a senior expert. She is highly skilled, can make good decisions, and can provide a consistent output of good quality. This is the stage when you can delegate tasks. Your main goals at this stage are to set high-level goals, monitor progress, and take part in high-level decision-making.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Defining tasks in a clear way</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The situational leadership model is useful, but it does not tell you how to describe tasks so that your teammates will be in sync with your vision. First, you should be aware that your task descriptions should not be the same for every team member. Your descriptions will vary, depending on competence and motivation levels. At the direction stage, a task description can resemble a low-level and detailed <strong>to-do</strong> <strong>list</strong>, and at the delegation stage, a task description may be comprised of two sentences. However, no matter what stage you are at, your task description should be clear, time-bounded, and realistic. SMART criteria helps create such descriptions.</p>
<p>SMART states that any task should be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific</strong>: Be concrete and target a specific area or goal</li>
<li><strong>Measurable</strong>: Have some indicator of progress</li>
<li><strong>Assignable</strong>: Have an assignee(s) who will do the task</li>
<li><strong>Realistic</strong>: State which results can be achieved when given a set of constraints and available resources</li>
<li><strong>Time-related</strong>: State a time constraint or a deadline</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to memorize this. The SMART criteria is a convenient checklist that will help your team understand you better. Nonetheless, no matter how detailed your task description is, talk it through with the assignee. Our language can be very ambiguous, and our thoughts are often unclear, even to ourselves. Just go over to your colleague after composing a task description and ask: <em>How did you understand this?</em> <em>Can we talk this through for 1-2 minutes?</em> Or talk through each task at your iteration planning meetings if you are using agile methodologies. These conversations are an essential part of a task's assignment. Even a subtle difference in understanding can give you unexpected and completely incorrect results.</p>
<p>Spending several minutes discussing the task at hand will help you make sure of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your understanding of tasks and that their goals are correct and realistic</li>
<li>Your task description is sufficient</li>
<li>You and the assignee are in sync regarding what needs to be done</li>
<li>The assignee understands what the result should look like</li>
<li>The deadlines are realistic</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Developing empathy</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Basic concepts such as leadership by example, situational leadership, and the SMART criteria will help you structure and measure your work as a team leader. However, there is another crucial component, without which your team can fall apart, even with the perfect execution of formal leadership functions. This component is empathy. Being empathetic means to understand your emotions, as well as other people's emotions. Our reactions are mostly irrational, and we often confuse our own feelings and emotions. For example, it is easy to confuse anger for fear; we can act angrily when in reality we are just afraid. Understanding your own emotions and learning to recognize others will help you understand people and see subtleties and motives behind their actions. Empathy helps us find the logic behind irrational actions so that we can react properly. It may be easy to answer with anger in regard to aggressive behavior unless you can understand the motives behind those actions. If you can see those motives, acting angrily may seem foolish in the end. Empathy is the ultimate conflict-resolution tool; it helps build trust and coherency in the team. It also takes an important part in negotiations, which we will talk about later.</p>
<p>Being empathetic is not an innate ability. Of course, some people are naturally more empathetic than others, but this does not mean that empathy can't be acquired. It is a skill, and like any other skill, it can be mastered if you work on it. To increase your empathy, start with yourself. Be aware of your own emotions throughout the day. If you encounter a complex situation, think through your actions and emotions. Try to understand which of your responses were adequate and which were not to see what caused them and what you felt at that moment. Sometimes, you will find mismatches between your feelings and your actions. Learn from them. Over time, you will start to understand emotions better and better. First, learn to understand yourself, and then you will be able to read others' emotions much better than before.</p>
<p>Another important tool that will help you build empathy and understand others is active listening. We listen to others each day, but do we extract all the available information from their speech? In fact, we leave most of it behind. When listening, we are often distracted by our own thoughts. We do not pay attention to the speaker and are eager to talk. </p>
<p>You may have heard that you can achieve a lot more by letting others speak. Imagine yourself in a conflict situation. Your beloved teammate comes to the office at 3 P.M. without notice for the third day in a row. When you ask them what's wrong, they harshly ask you to go away. You may immediately want to react in the same aggressive way. However, in this situation, it is much better to understand the reason behind such behavior. Unknown factors can clarify such seemingly illogical behavior and show your teammate's situation in a different light. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Simply staring and hoping that the information will flow into you is optimistic. If the person in front of you is not in the mood to talk, this may make the situation worse. To get around this, you should listen actively. Active listening involves a set of techniques that will help others speak more openly.</p>
<p>To listen actively, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay full attention to the speaker</strong>: We often drift into our own thoughts when others speak for long periods of time. The speaker will immediately notice that you are in the clouds, and it will negatively affect their urge to share information with you.</li>
<li><strong>Show that you are paying attention</strong>: Give feedback using <em>uh-huhs</em>, saying <em>yes</em>, by nodding, and by smiling. The other person shouldn't feel like they are talking to a concrete wall.</li>
<li><strong>Paraphrase and mirror</strong>: This is when you repeat the last two or three words of the last phrase. When you paraphrase, you repeat or sum up the last phrase in different words; for example, <em>I hear that you want to</em>…. This may seem awkward at first, but believe me, mirroring works. This is the most important tool for active listening. It cultivates the flow of information between the speaker and the listener. After learning about paraphrasing and mirroring, I noticed that good speakers use them constantly, and they do not do this consciously. There is no reason for you not to employ this tool.</li>
<li><strong>Do not judge, ever</strong>: Openly judging others will trigger their defense mechanism and break the flow of information.</li>
<li><strong>Verbalize emotions to understand what others feel</strong>: Empathy is a hard skill to master, but often you can take a handy shortcut: verbalize the other person's feelings. <em>I feel that you are upset, am I right?</em> If you are right, the other person will confirm that, and if you are wrong, you will get a clue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Active listening is simple on paper but may be tricky in the real world. As with any skill, you can practice it to perfection. Follow this simple advice in your daily conversations and you will notice the effects.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Facilitating a growth mindset</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The last key component of team building we will cover is a growth mindset. The constant growth of your team is necessary if you do not want it to fall apart. Without growth, there will be no motivation, no new goals, and no progress. We can distill team growth into two components: the global growth of a team as a whole and the local growth of each individual team member.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Growing the expertise of your team as a whole</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Global growth happens when your team gets through challenges, develops projects, and is given new opportunities. Global team growth happens alongside the expansion of your company. But the contrary is not true: if your company's business grows, it does not mean that your team will automatically get better and see new opportunities. Learning lessons as a team is a crucial part of the formula. It just so happens that you'll have more opportunities to learn when your company does not stagnate. Each time something good happens, you and your team should learn from it. When bad things arise, learn from them too. When something significant happens, make sure that the information propagates through your team and back to you again. </p>
<p>A great tool for learning is making retrospectives and internal meetups. Retrospectives are project team meetings where everyone on the team answers three simple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What have we done right?</li>
<li>What have we done wrong?</li>
<li>What should we do to improve?</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrospectives allow you and your team members to get feedback and improve on it. They are also an effective project management tool that will improve your team's output. On a larger scale, everyone on the team should have a chance to share an experience with others, and to get useful feedback not only from their manager but from others in the team too. </p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Applying continuous learning for personal growth</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>While global team growth through learning from daily experience can be achieved by following a process, personal growth is not that easy. One important question I often ask myself is: <em>How do I get people motivated to learn?</em> It is extremely hard to grow as a professional from just day-to-day work experience in data science, which is the same for every other tech field. To grow individually, and as part of your team, your colleagues have to learn. Getting new knowledge is hard for some people, especially those who stopped actively learning right after graduating. Learning is a habit, and everyone can develop an urge to get new knowledge. The key idea behind a growth mindset is that we should not stop expanding our knowledge once we have graduated. Knowledge is limitless and, nowadays, anything you want to learn is at your fingertips; you just need to put some effort into it. The ability to learn continuously without pauses and interruptions through your life is a true treasure that allows unlimited self-development. If you think about it, almost any goal is achievable with enough knowledge and persistence.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The key to personal or local growth is learning continuously. If you want to motivate your team members to learn and grow, you must give them the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of continuous learning is a tool that will help your teammates make learning into a habit.</li>
<li>Not everyone has personal time to learn, and even if they have, not everyone is eager to spend it on learning right from the start. Learning and research activities at work may be a good way to develop a habit.</li>
<li>A personal learning plan will help everyone structure and track their goals.</li>
<li>The project, learning, and other goals of a performance review process will help you with the feedback flow in the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now look at each point separately, starting with continuous learning. The main idea behind it is that it does not matter whether you read a whole book in one day or a single informative tweet: all learning counts. You should aim to learn something new each day—even a small amount. In the end, you will not only move a bit closer to the goal of learning something but also develop a set of habits that will allow you to gain more and more knowledge without even noticing it. After a while, continuous learning will be a part of your life, developing a natural hunger for new, useful information, like a scheduler that optimizes your free time in the background and squeezes spare minutes you spend commuting and waiting in long store lines to help you progress toward something that really matters to you.</p>
<p>The trick of continuous learning is to educate yourself to achieve your learning goals in small batches. If you are in the mood, you are likely to continue and do more work. If not, you will still have learned something new and moved on.</p>
<p>At first, this can be a way of achieving a singular goal. Then, after achieving the first accomplishments, you'll realize that this way of thinking allows you to learn more: apply it to a new area of expertise, skill, or topic of interest. A few months later, it will become a part of your life, helping you get better at it every day.</p>

<p>Starting a habit is not an easy process. To really stick, a habit should be repeated many times. You should provide as many learning opportunities for your team as possible. If you want your team to grow by itself and constantly develop, make sure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A learning plan template</li>
<li>Planned time for research and education</li>
<li>Compensation options for paid courses and books </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that the learning plan template is easily reachable; place it on your company wiki or any other online source. The learning plan template should contain all the skills, books, and online courses that you and your team consider useful for gaining new competencies. This page should be frequently updated with links to new material that your team finds. Split all the material into categories.</p>
<p>In particular, for a data science learning plan template, you can consider the following categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematics:
<ul>
<li>Mathematical analysis and optimization</li>
<li>Linear algebra</li>
<li>Mathematical statistics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data science:
<ul>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Deep learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data engineering:
<ul>
<li>Relational databases</li>
<li>Data warehousing</li>
<li>Big data</li>
<li>Business intelligence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software engineering:
<ul>
<li>Software architecture and patterns</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>All of those topics should contain links to books, online courses, and blog posts with commentaries about why this material is good and what the most useful parts of it are. It is even better to split each topic further into levels; for example, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. That way, you and anyone on your team can track which level of competency they are approximately at. This learning plan template can be used in a performance review to create and adjust personal learning plans. We will discuss this topic in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
<p>After creating the learning plan template, you can talk with everyone on your team to discover their professional goals. Ask them which areas they want to grow in and understand what interests them personally. Ask them to go through your learning plan template and write their approximate competency level in each topic and help them if they can't do this alone. With this information, you will understand where each team member is now and where they want to go. You can then create a personal learning plan. I find simple task-tracking systems such as Trello to be a good tool for tracking learning goals—create shared boards for your teammates and create cards in meetings. As with any task, a learning plan is better if it's defined in accordance with the SMART criteria. In particular, make sure it is realistic (reading 100 books a year may be a realistic goal for some people, but not for others) and time-bound. Each learning plan should have a deadline. At this deadline, you and your teammate should meet again and adjust the learning plan: decide on the next goal, create new cards, and delete obsolete goals. In your second meeting, you may discover that many learning plans have been unfinished. This means that you will need to adjust the amount of learning material for the next period. All that matters is that progress never stops, not how many learning cards have been completed.</p>
<p>Learning plans are worthless without planned time for research and education. Planned time can be personal, but you should not be confident that your team will educate itself only in their free time. Give them opportunities to learn in work hours too. It is common to have free gaps between projects or when waiting for someone to finish parts of the work you depend on. On rare occasions, some of your teammates could have several days of downtime, waiting for new tasks. Use this time wisely. You should communicate to your team that if they do not have any assigned tasks, they should learn according to their personal plan after reporting to you. In some cases, company policy can be against learning in the workplace. Try to communicate that learning is a long-term investment that will allow your team to perform better.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Another important component of forming a learning habit is to have compensation options for paid courses and books. Learning materials and online courses may be expensive. Your teammates may have other plans for their income than paying for books that will make them better at work. If someone understands that investing in education will have much greater returns, that's great, but not everyone will understand this from the start. People need to experience this process by themselves. They need to see that learning helps them to improve, both in terms of income and skills. Having corporate plans for compensating successfully finished courses or books is not expensive, and it will kick-start learning habits for your team.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Helping employees to grow with performance reviews</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The last but not the least component, is a performance review. The sole purpose of a performance review is to share bidirectional feedback and have a clear view of individual progress. The number of ways you can try to track performance is infinite. Many companies use some kind of <strong>key performance indicator</strong> (<strong>KPI</strong>) system. A KPI is a single number that should be an adequate measure of your success. The total amount of sales in $ is a frequent KPI in sales departments. It may seem to be a good KPI at first. Sales departments should sell, right? Tying the department's success to this number is akin to telling everyone: <em>All you should think of is selling more. Nothing else.</em> But this is a very short-term goal. The reality of sales departments is much more high-dimensional than a single number. If we transition to software development or data science departments, KPIs become even more cumbersome and complex. How will you measure a programmer's or a data scientist's performance? Maybe we can take a number of experiments, or a number of lines of code per day? All of these measures are utterly irrelevant to real success.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I haven't seen a successful implementation of an individual KPI yet. KPIs work best for business processes, while personal KPIs are very one-dimensional and unrealistic. If you tie an individual's success to a single number, they will either end up fighting with the system or exploiting it. A better but more time-consuming way to track performance and set goals is by using performance reviews. A performance review is typically carried out once or twice a year.</p>
<p>The process is comprised of several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask your teammate to write everything that they have done since the last performance review, such as completed projects, major achievements at work, open source contributions, books, and so on. Let's assume that the teammate's name is Matt.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Send a description of this to the colleagues who worked together with Matt. You should include as many people as you can: project managers, product owners, and team members. Ask them to answer the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What have you liked about working with Matt?</li>
<li>What could be improved? What parts did you not like?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have worked with Matt as a manager on some projects, prepare answers to those questions yourself.</li>
<li>Anonymize all the reviews and prepare a single performance review report.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the report is done, you should share it with Matt and set up a meeting. It is a good idea to share the report before the meeting so that Matt can ponder the feedback for a while and derive conclusions. In the meeting, discuss each point and make sure that you are both on the same page regarding the feedback. Decide on the most important parts that need to be improved. If Matt has achieved new heights that you set in the previous performance review, you should be considering a promotion or a bonus. It is important to give equal attention to both positive and negative feedback. Try to make performance reviews stand out. They should be memorable. We should try to create nice-looking review templates, with good typography and a healthy dose of memes. We should also print all the reviews on nice paper so that anyone can take them out. A performance review should create positive memories, especially if the feedback is more on the bad side. You should give your team the motivation to improve and do not forget to collect reviews for yourself. As a manager, you can make many mistakes without even knowing about them. Getting feedback from your team is as important for you as it is for them.</p>
<p>It is important to lead by example if you want to facilitate the growth mindset in your team. If you want anyone to inherit principles of continuous learning, learning plans, and educational goals, do this yourself. Demonstrate that this works. That way, you will kill two birds with one stone: you will vastly improve yourself, and you will show your team how the ideas you speak about really work.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at how to apply the advice that's been provided in this chapter by looking at a case study.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Case study—creating a data science department</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A large manufacturing company has decided to open a new data science department. They hired Robert as an experienced team leader and asked him to build the new department.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The first thing Robert did was research the scenarios his department should handle. He discovered that the understanding of data science was still vague in the company, and while some managers expected the department to build machine learning models and seek new data science use cases in the company, others wanted him to build data dashboards and reports. To create a balanced team, Robert first documented two team goals and confirmed that his views correctly summed up what the company's management wanted from the new team:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data stewardship: </strong>Creating data marts, reports, and dashboards from the company's data warehouses based on incoming requests from management</li>
<li><strong>Data science: </strong>Searching for advanced analytics use cases, implementing prototypes, and defending project ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, Robert thought about team size limits and asked about the approximate volume of requests they would get every month for each goal. For the data stewardship part, management already had a big backlog formed, and they needed all the tasks to be completed as soon as possible. As for the data science part, management did not have any preexisting requests, but they wanted the team to find and suggest new data science use cases in the next three months. Management noticed that they were ready to invest in the data science goal by creating a team of no more than four experts. </p>
<p>From this information, Robert derived the following team roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data team leader</strong>: To supervise two data teams and coordinate projects at a higher level. The workload in this role is not expected to be high during the first year of the team's existence.</li>
<li><strong>Data stewardship team</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Team leader/project manager</strong>: The goal definition clearly required someone to manage incoming requests and plan the work. </li>
<li><strong>Systems analyst</strong>: Someone to document visualization and reporting requirements that come from the stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Data analyst</strong>: To implement data reports and dashboards based on the requirements defined by the systems analyst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data science team</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Team leader/project manager</strong>: Should be able to manage R&amp;D processes in a business environment.</li>
<li><strong>Business analyst</strong>: To interview company management and search for potential data science use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Systems analyst</strong>: To search for data and provide requirements for the use cases provided by the business analyst.</li>
<li><strong>Data scientist</strong>: To implement prototypes based on the task definitions provided by the business analyst and systems analyst.</li>
<li><strong>Backend software engineer</strong>: To integrate prototypes with external systems and implement software based on the requirements.</li>
<li><strong>User interface software engineer</strong>: To implement interactive UIs and visualizations for prototype presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, Robert thought about team size constraints and created the following positions from the preceding roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data team leader</strong>: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Employees needed</strong>: 1. This position will be handled by Robert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data stewardship team</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Team leader</strong>: Employees needed: 1. Robert had no prior experience leading data analysis teams, so he decided to hire an experienced manager who will work under his supervision.</li>
<li><strong>Systems analyst</strong>: Employees needed: 1.</li>
<li><strong>Data analyst</strong>: Employees needed: 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data science team</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Team leader</strong>: Employees needed: 1. During the first year, this position will be handled by Robert, as the volume of projects won't be so high that this work will interfere with the data team leader role. As he will be acting as the best expert in the team, Robert has carefully thought about how to delegate tasks using situational leadership so that the data scientists on his team will be motivated and will have room to grow and take on more complex tasks along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Business analyst</strong>: Employees needed: 1.</li>
<li><strong>Systems analyst</strong>: Employees needed: 0. Robert has decided that there is no need for keeping system and business analysis separate since the system analysis could be performed cross-functionally by the whole team at the R&amp;D stage.</li>
<li><strong>Data scientist and backend software engineer</strong>: Employees needed: 2. Robert decided to combine data scientists and backend software engineers into a single position since the software engineering requirements for the prototype projects were easy enough to be handled by data scientists. He decided to hire two experts so that he could work on several ideas simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Next, Robert defined a workflow for each position to create accurate job descriptions and interview scenarios, as described in <a href="0f8f01a4-419c-44fe-abb1-f8ed6b6037fa.xhtml"/><a href="0f8f01a4-419c-44fe-abb1-f8ed6b6037fa.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Conducting a Data Science Interview.</em> To facilitate the growth mindset, he defined learning plan templates for each team role based on his experience. He focused on roles instead of positions because some combined positions may split when the team grows, and role-based growth tracks will allow those splits to occur naturally. Robert also created a quick team leader guide where he stated the standards for task delegation based on situational leadership and the SMART criteria and set up a performance review schedule for each team.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we explored the complex topic of building and sustaining a team. First, we dived into the concept of team balance and looked at why it is crucial for a team's survival in the long term. Then, we learned about several leadership styles, including the situational leadership model and leadership by example. We then saw how we can create good task descriptions using the SMART criteria. We also mentioned empathy and active listening as the most important soft skills of a leader. We also explored the concepts of continuous learning and a growth mindset. Finally, we saw how a performance review process can help learning habits develop in your team.</p>
<p>This chapter concludes the <em>Building and Sustaining a Team </em>section of this book; congratulations on finishing it! The next section of this book will cover the topic of managing data science projects.</p>

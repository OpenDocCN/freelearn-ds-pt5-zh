- en: '*Learning Jupyter* discusses using Jupyter to record your scripts and produce
    results for data analysis projects. Jupyter allows data scientists to record their
    complete analysis process, much in the same way that other scientists use a lab
    notebook for recording tests, progress, results, and conclusions. Jupyter works
    in a variety of operating systems, and this book covers the use of Jupyter in
    Windows and macOS, along with the various steps necessary to enable your specific
    needs. Jupyter supports a variety of scripting languages by the addition of language
    engines, so the user can use their particular script in a native fashion.'

- en: This book is written for readers who wants to portray software solutions to
    others in a natural programming context. Jupyter provides a mechanism to execute
    a number of different languages and stores the results directly for display, as
    if the user ran those scripts on their own machine.

- en: '[Chapter 1](5b555482-7a8c-4327-8d4a-b7223db52388.xhtml), *Introduction to Jupyter*,
    investigates the various user interface elements available in a notebook. We will
    learn how to install the software on a macOS or a PC. We will expose the notebook
    structure. We will see the typical workflow used when developing a notebook. We
    will walk through the user interface operations available in a Notebook. And lastly,
    we will see some of the configuration options available to advanced users for
    their notebook.'

    walks through a simple notebook and the underlying structure. Then, we will see
    an example of using pandas and looked at a graphics example. Finally, we will
    look at an example using random numbers in a Python script.'

    adds the ability to use R scripts in our Jupyter Notebook. We will add an R library
    that''s not included in the standard R installation, and we will make a `Hello
    World` script in R. We will then see R data access built-in libraries and some
    of the simpler graphics and statistics that are automatically generated. We will
    use an R script to generate 3D graphics in a couple of different ways. We will
    then perform a standard cluster analysis (which I think is one of the basic uses
    of R) and use one of the forecasting tools. We will also build a prediction model
    and test its accuracy.'

    adds the ability to use Julia scripts in our Jupyter Notebook. We will add a Julia
    library that''s not included in the standard Julia installation. We will see the
    basic features of Julia in use, and also outline some of the limitations that
    are encountered using Julia in Jupyter. We will display graphics using some of
    the available graphics packages. Finally, we will see parallel processing in action,
    a small control flow example, and how to add unit testing to your Julia script.'

    explains how to install the Java engine into Jupyter. We will see examples of
    the different output presentations available from Java in Jupyter. Then, we will
    investigate using optional fields. We will see what a compile error looks like
    in Java in Jupyter. Next, we will see several examples of lambdas. We will use
    collections for several purposes. Lastly, we will generate summary statistics
    for one of the standard datasets.'

    Coding*, shows how to add JavaScript to our Jupyter Notebook. We will see some
    of the limitations of using JavaScript in Jupyter. We will look at examples of
    several packages that are typical of Node.js coding, including graphics, statistics,
    built-in JSON handling, and creating graphics files with a third-party tool. We
    will also see how multithreaded applications can be developed using Node.js under
    Jupyter. Lastly, we will use machine learning to develop a decision tree.'

    how to install Scala for Jupyter. We will use Scala coding to access large datasets.
    We will see how Scala can manipulate arrays. We will generate random numbers in
    Scala. There are examples of higher-order functions and pattern matching. We will
    use case classes. We will see examples of immutability in Scala. We will build
    collections using Scala packages, and we will look at Scala traits.'

    discusses using Spark functionality via Python coding for Jupyter. First, we will
    install the Spark additions to Jupyter on a Windows machine and a macOS machine.
    We will write an initial script that just read lines from a text file. We will
    go further and determine the word count in that file. We will add sorting to the
    results. There is a script to estimate pi. We will evaluate web log files for
    anomalies. We will determine a set of prime numbers, and we will evaluate a text
    stream for some characteristics.'

    and interactive widgets to produce a variety of user input controls. We will then
    look at the widgets package in depth to investigate some of the available user
    controls, properties available in the containers, and events that can be emitted

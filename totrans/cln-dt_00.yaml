    calculating machine, recollects being dumbfounded at the "confusion of ideas"
    that would prompt someone to assume that a computer could calculate the correct
    answer despite being given the wrong input. Fast-forward another 100 years, and
    the tax bureaucracy started patiently explaining "garbage in, garbage out" to
    express the idea that even for the all-powerful tax collector, computer processing
    is still dependent on the quality of its input. Fast-forward another 50 years
    to 2015: a seemingly magical age of machine learning, autocorrect, anticipatory
    interfaces, and recommendation systems that know me better than I know myself.
    Yet, all of these helpful algorithms still require high-quality data in order
    to learn properly in the first place, and we lament "there are no clean datasets".'

- en: This book is for anyone who works with data on a regular basis, whether as a
    data scientist, data journalist, software developer, or something else. The goal
    is to teach practical strategies to quickly and easily bridge the gap between
    the data we want and the data we have. We want high-quality, perfect data, but
    the reality is that most often, our data falls far short. Whether we are plagued
    with missing data, data in the wrong format, data in the wrong location, or anomalies
    in the data, the result is often, to paraphrase rapper Notorious B.I.G., "more
    data, more problems".

    step in the data science process: easily improved, never ignored. Our goal is
    to reframe data cleaning away from being a dreaded, tedious task that we must
    slog through in order to get to the *real* work. Instead, armed with a few tried-and-true
    procedures and tools, we will learn that just like in a kitchen, if you wash your
    vegetables first, your food will look better, taste better, and be better for
    you. If you learn a few proper knife skills, your meat will be more succulent
    and your vegetables will be cooked more evenly. The same way that a great chef
    will have their favorite knives and culinary traditions, a great data scientist
    will want to work with the very best data possible and under the very best conditions.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1 "Chapter 1. Why Do You Need Clean Data?"),
    *Why Do You Need Clean Data?* motivates our quest for clean data by showing the
    central role of data cleaning in the overall data science process. We follow with
    a simple example showing some dirty data from a real-world dataset. We weigh the
    pros and cons of each potential cleaning process, and then we describe how to
    communicate our cleaning changes to others.'

    foundational knowledge about file formats, compression, and data types, including
    missing and empty data and character encodings. Each section has its own examples
    taken from real-world datasets. This chapter is important because we will rely
    on knowledge of these basic concepts for the rest of the book.'

    common tools: the text editor and the spreadsheet. We will cover simple solutions
    to common problems, including how to use functions, search and replace, and regular
    expressions to correct and transform data. At the end of the chapter, we will
    put our skills to test using both of these tools to clean some real-world data
    regarding universities.'

    on converting data from one format to another. This is one of the most important
    data cleaning tasks, and it is useful to have a variety of tools at hand to easily
    complete this task. We first proceed through each of the different conversions
    step by step, including back and forth between common formats such as comma-separated
    values (CSV), JSON, and SQL. To put our new data conversion skills into practice,
    we complete a project where we download a Facebook friend network and convert
    it into a few different formats so that we can visualize its shape.'

    stored in Adobe''s Portable Document Format (PDF) files. We first examine low-cost
    tools to accomplish this task, then we try a few low-barrier-to-entry tools, and
    finally, we experiment with the Adobe non-free software itself. As always, we
    use real-world data for our experiments, and this provides a wealth of experience

- en: If you are reading this book, I guess you are probably in one of two groups.
    One group is the group of data scientists who already spend a lot of time cleaning
    data, but you want to get better at it. You are probably frustrated with the tedium
    of data cleaning, and you are looking for ways to speed it up, become more efficient,
    or just use different tools to get the job done. In our kitchen metaphor, you
    are the chef who just needs to brush up on a few knife skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other group is made up of people doing the data science work but who never
    really cared about data cleaning before. But now, you are starting to think that
    maybe your results might actually get better if you had a cleaning process. Maybe
    the old adage "garbage in, garbage out" is starting to feel a little too real.
    Maybe you are interested in sharing your data with others, but you do not feel
    confident about the quality of the datasets you are producing. With this book,
    you will gain enough confidence to "cook in public" by learning a few tricks and
    creating new habits that will ensure a tidy, clean data science environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either way, this book will help you reframe data cleaning away from being a
    symbol of drudgery and toward being your hallmark of quality, good taste, style,
    and efficiency. You should probably have a bit of programming background, but
    you do not have to be great at it. As with most data science projects, a willingness
    to learn and experiment as well as a healthy sense of curiosity and a keen attention
    to detail are all very important and valued.

This includes data for millions of open source projects and their developers.\n\nIf you use FLOSSmole data, please cite it accordingly:\nHowison, J., Conklin, M., & Crowston, K. (2006). FLOSSmole: A collaborative repository for FLOSS research data and analyses. International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering, 1(3), 17–26.\n\nWhat is included on this site? \nFlat files, date and time-stamped, from various software forges & projects. We have a lot of other data in our database that is not available here in flat files. For example, IRC logs and email from various projects. For those, see the following:\n\n1\\. Direct database access. Please use this link for direct access to our MySQL database: http://flossmole.org/content/direct-db-access-flossmole-collection-available\n\n2\\. FLOSSmole web site.

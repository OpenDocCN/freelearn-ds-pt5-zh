It is the essential art of gathering and examining pieces of information to suit a variety of purposes—from visual inspection to machine learning techniques. Through data analysis, we can harness the meaning from information littered all around the digital realm. It enables us to resolve the most peculiar inquiries, perhaps even summoning new ones in the process.</p><p>Haskell acts as our conduit for robust data analysis. For some, Haskell is a programming language reserved to the most elite researchers in academia and industry. Yet, we see it charming one of the fastest growing cultures of open source developers around the world. The growth of Haskell is a sign that people are uncovering its magnificent functional pureness, resilient type safety, and remarkable expressiveness. Flip the pages of this book to see it all in action.</p><p>
<em>Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook</em> is more than just a fusion of two entrancing topics in computing. It is also a learning tool for the Haskell programming language and an introduction to simple data analysis practices. Use it as a Swiss Army Knife of algorithms and code snippets. Try a recipe a day, like a kata for your mind. Breeze through the book for creative inspiration from catalytic examples. Also, most importantly, dive deep into the province of data analysis in Haskell.</p><p>Of course, none of this would have been possible without a thorough feedback from the technical editors, brilliant chapter illustrations by Lonku (<a class="ulink" href="http://lonku.tumblr.com">http://lonku.tumblr.com</a>), and helpful layout and editing support by Packt Publishing.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Apply the <code class="literal">readString</code> function to the input, and get all date documents."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">main :: IO () 
main = do 
  input &lt;- readFile "input.txt"
  print input</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">main :: IO () 
main = do 
  <strong>input &lt;- readFile "input.txt"</strong>
  print input</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>$ runhaskell Main.hs</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus, or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Under the <strong>Downloads</strong> section, download the cabal source package."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>

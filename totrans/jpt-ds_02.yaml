    you can do things like select part of one data frame and combine/join with parts
    of another data frame. Very quickly, you end up with SQL-like manipulations that
    can be performed on database tables. With that point of view, you are open to
    a much wider spectrum of data manipulation than would appear in the base data
    frame.

- en: Sorting in most languages means re-organizing the dataset that you are working
    with. In data frames, sorting can be accomplished by selecting another index to
    access the data frame. All data frames start out with a basic incremental row
    index built-in by NumPy. You can change the index used to access the data frame
    and effectively sort the data frame in the manner that you want.

- en: In this chapter, we looked at some of the more compute intensive tasks that
    might be performed in Jupyter. We used Python to scrape a website to gather data
    for analysis. We used Python NumPy, pandas, and SciPy functions for in-depth computation
    of results. We went further into pandas and explored manipulating data frames.
    Lastly, we saw examples of sorting and filtering data frames.

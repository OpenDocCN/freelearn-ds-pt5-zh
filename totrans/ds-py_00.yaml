- en: First, let me thank you and congratulate you, the reader, for the decision to
    invest some of your valuable time to read this book. Throughout the chapters to
    come, I will take you on a journey of discovering or even re-discovering data
    science from the perspective of a developer and will develop the theme of this
    book which is that data science is a team sport and that if it is to be successful,
    developers will have to play a bigger role in the near future and better collaborate
    with data scientists. However, to make data science more inclusive to people of
    all backgrounds and trades, we first need to *democratize it by making data simple
    and accessible*—this is in essence what this book is about.

  zh: 首先，我要感谢并祝贺你，亲爱的读者，做出决定，投资宝贵的时间来阅读这本书。在接下来的章节中，我将带领你从开发者的角度来发现或重新发现数据科学，并阐述本书的主题，即数据科学是一项团队运动，如果它要成功，开发者将在不久的将来扮演更重要的角色，并且与数据科学家更好地合作。然而，为了使数据科学更加包容各行各业的人，我们首先需要通过让数据变得简单和可访问来*让它民主化*——这实际上就是本书的核心内容。

  zh: 我为什么要写这本书？
- en: As I'll explain in more detail in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml "Chapter 1. Programming
    and Data Science – A New Toolset"), *Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset*,
    I am first and foremost a developer with over 20 years, experience of building
    software components of a diverse nature; frontend, backend, middleware, and so
    on. Reflecting back on this time, I realize how much getting the algorithms right
    always came first in my mind; data was always somebody else's problem. I rarely
    had to analyze it or extract insight from it. At best, I was designing the right data
    structure to load it in a way that would make my algorithm run more efficiently
    and the code more elegant and reusable.

  zh: 正如我将在[第一章](ch01.xhtml "第一章. 编程与数据科学 – 一套新工具")中详细解释的那样，*编程与数据科学 – 一套新工具*，我首先是一名开发者，拥有超过20年的多样化软件组件构建经验；包括前端、后端、中间件等等。回顾这段时光，我意识到，每当我思考时，正确的算法总是放在首位；数据总是别人的问题。我很少需要分析数据或从中提取洞察。充其量，我只是设计合适的数据结构，以便以一种更高效、更优雅且可复用的方式加载数据，进而使我的算法运行得更加顺畅。
- en: However, as the Artificial Intelligence and data science revolution got under
    way, it became obvious to me that developers like myself needed to get involved,
    and so 7 years ago in 2011, I jumped at the opportunity to become the lead architect
    for the IBM Watson core platform UI & Tooling. Of course, I don't pretend to have
    become an expert in machine learning or NLP, far from it. Learning through practice
    is not a substitute for getting a formal academic background.

  zh: 然而，随着人工智能和数据科学革命的展开，我很明显地意识到像我这样的开发者需要参与其中，因此，7年前的2011年，我抓住机会成为IBM Watson核心平台UI与工具的首席架构师。当然，我并不自称已成为机器学习或自然语言处理领域的专家，远非如此。通过实践学习并不能替代获得正式的学术背景。
- en: However, a big part of what I want to demonstrate in this book is that, with
    the right tools and approach, someone equipped with the right mathematical foundations
    (I'm only talking about high-school level calculus concepts really) can quickly
    become a good practitioner in the field. A key ingredient to being successful
    is to simplify as much as possible the different steps of building a data pipeline;
    from acquiring, loading, and cleaning the data, to visualizing and exploring it,
    all the way to building and deploying machine learning models.

  zh: 然而，我在本书中想要展示的一个重要观点是，凭借正确的工具和方法，拥有合适数学基础的人（我这里只谈高中的微积分概念）可以迅速成为这一领域的优秀从业者。成功的关键之一是尽可能简化构建数据管道的不同步骤；从获取、加载、清洗数据，到可视化和探索，再到构建和部署机器学习模型。

    to a community beyond data scientists that, 3 years ago, I took on a leading role
    at the IBM Watson Data Platform team with the mission of expanding the community
    of developers working with data with a special focus on education and activism
    on their behalf. During that time as the lead developer advocate, I started to
    talk openly about the need for developers and data scientists to better collaborate
    in solving complex data problems.

    are connected to a Spark cluster.

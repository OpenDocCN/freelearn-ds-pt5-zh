                    <h1 class="header-title">Closing Thoughts on Big Data</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have covered a broad range of topics thus far. We have looked at technologies used for big data, for data science, and for machine learning. We have learned about how companies are implementing their big data corporate strategies. We have also developed a handful of real-world applications along the way.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses the practical considerations of big data or data science initiatives at corporations. The field is continually evolving, with the introduction of newer technologies, newer open source tools, and new concepts in data mining. Due to this, organizations of all sizes share common challenges.</p>
<p>Data science success stories are everywhere in the media. In fact, most, if not all, of the investment happening in technology today has some connection to aspects of data science. Indeed, it has become an indispensable and integral aspect of IT development.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss a few of the common themes of implementing data science, the shared challenges, and what you can do to make your initiative successful. Further, we’ll look at major successes in data science as well as examples where data science failed to live up to its promise. We’ll also provide a set of links to resources where you can go to learn more about the relevant topics.</p>
<p>The following subjects will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate big data and data science strategy</li>
<li>Ethical considerations</li>
<li>Silicon Valley and data science</li>
<li>The human factor</li>
<li>Links for further reading</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Corporate big data and data science strategy</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have read about it in the papers, you have seen it on the evening news, you have heard about it from your friends – big data and data science are everywhere and they are here to stay.</p>
<p>The success stories from Silicon Valley have made the effect even more pronounced. Who would have thought that a ride-sharing and ride-hailing phone application, Uber, could become one of the most popular companies in the world with an estimated valuation of close to $70 billion. Sites and apps such as Airbnb turned apartment-sharing into a booming business, becoming the second most valued company at $30 billion.</p>
<p>These and other similar events transformed the topics of big data and data science from being purely theoretical and technical subjects into common terminology that people have come to associate with unbounded investment success.</p>
<p>Since nearly all major technology vendors have started adding features categorized as <em>big data</em>, nearly all companies that invest in technology today are using some facets of big data, knowingly or otherwise.</p>
<p>The process of implementing however, is very loosely defined. As such, there is no definitive framework, other than perhaps Hadoop, which has been the de facto framework that most companies have adopted. Senior level management are often aware of the big picture, namely, the value that big data can bring to their organizations. However, the path to realizing the vision is challenging and as such there is no definitive solution that can guarantee success. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three stages of implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dormant</strong>: When the company has not yet established a firm mandate, but there are discussions about big data</li>
<li><strong>Passive</strong>: The discussions start taking a more formal shape, usually leading to the delegation of a team/teams to assess the impact and value to the organization</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: The company starts assessing technologies and engages in active implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>The ownership of the big data and/or data science strategy can be somewhat confusing. This is due to the fact that the field encompasses elements of both analytics as well as technology. The former, analytics, is usually owned by the business-facing divisions of the organization, whereas technology is owned by IT departments. However, in data science, both elements are required. Individuals who are data <em>specialists</em>, that is, those who understand the domain very well and have experience with the data used in the domain, can be great business subject matter experts. They may also be able to comprehensively identify the ideal use cases and how the data can be best utilized. However, without having strong technical acumen, it would be difficult to identify the right tools to realize the vision.</p>
<p>In similar terms, an IT manager may be very knowledgeable about big data-related technologies, but would require the feedback of business stakeholders to effectively determine which of the various solutions will meet the specific immediate and long-term needs of the organization.</p>
<p>In other words, multiple cross-disciplinary streams need to collaborate in order to implement a truly effective organizational big data ecosystem.</p>
<p>The process of realizing the strategy is generally either <em>top-down</em> or <em>bottom-up</em>. However, rather than adopting a rigid directional approach, a collaborative, iterative, and agile process is often the best solution. There will be decisions, and changes to decisions based on new requirements and discoveries during the course of assessing big data needs, and prior evaluations may need to be modified in order to meet modified objectives.</p>
<p>The bottom-up approach involves structuring decisions starting at the IT level. The top-down approach, which is arguably more common, involves making decisions starting at the management level. Neither is generally optimal. The ideal approach is one where there is a continuous feedback loop that adjusts requirements based on a process of discovery:</p>

<p>In contrast, the top-down approach is as follows:</p>

<p>Neither the bottom-up nor the top-down approach is optimal for a successful big data initiative. A better option is a collaborative process that takes into account the shifting needs and diverse requirements of different departments that stand to benefit from the implementation of a big data platform:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Ethical considerations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Big data often involves the gathering of large volumes of data that may contain users' personal information. Companies such as Facebook and Google have flourished on analyzing individual information to target ads and perform other types of marketing. This evidently poses an ethical dilemma. To what extent should personal data be collected? And how much is <em>too much?</em> There are, of course, no correct answers to these questions. The rise of hacking in which information from hundreds of millions of user accounts has been compromised is so commonplace today that we have almost become complacent about the consequences.</p>
<p>In October 2017, Yahoo! disclosed that 3 billion accounts, in fact every single account on Yahoo!, had suffered a data breach. <strong>Equifax</strong>, one of the largest credit reporting companies in the US suffered a data breach that exposed the personal details of more than 140 million consumers. There were scores of other similar incidents, and in all of them, the common denominator was that all the companies collected some level of users' personal information, whether directly or via third parties.</p>
<p>In essence, whenever user-related information is involved, it begets the implementation of suitable IT security in order to ensure that the data does not get compromised. The repercussions are not limited to only the loss of data, but collateral damage due to impact on reputation and goodwill, apart from the primary fact that real people are involved whose data has been compromised.</p>
<p>Thus, the security of big data, whenever it involves sensitive information and/or any personal information, becomes critically important. Cloud providers, such as AWS and Azure, have gained traction partly due to the fact that they have very stringent standards of security as well as certifications that allow organizations to offload the responsibility to a trusted and formidable entity.</p>
<p>The EU <strong>GDPR</strong> (<strong>General Data Privacy Regulation</strong>), effective May 2018, is an excellent step toward securing the personal data of its citizens. In a nutshell, the GDPR regulates the use of any personal data. In this context, the term any is extremely broad, including even the very name of an individual. Violators of the rule will be fined up to 20 million euro, or 4 percent of the global turnover of the defaulting organization.</p>
<p>While this will evidently reduce the availability of <em>Big Data</em> datasets, especially those that relate to individual data, it may also stir a debate and perhaps innovations on how data can be put to best use within the constraints, that is, getting value from data without using personal information.</p>
<p>On the other hand, countries such as the US have been relaxing laws around the collection of personal data. In early 2017, the US removed privacy protections around collection of personal information by internet service providers and in fact made it legal for ISPs such as AT&amp;T to not only collect but also sell users' browsing and app data.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Silicon Valley and data science</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Several of the key innovations we see today in big data have emerged from Silicon Valley. The region has been a tech hub for decades and has launched some of the most successful companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and eBay. The presence of universities, such as the University of California at Berkeley, has made access to talent relatively easy.</p>
<p>That said, the cost of living in the region has sky-rocketed, especially in the wake of the growth of the big data and data science industry. Today, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is well above $3,500 per month, making it more expensive than even New York City.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley, however, is synonymous with success and many new entrepreneurs are drawn to the region. Startups have sprung up, many of them commanding tens of millions of dollars in VC investment. However, entrepreneurs should heed statistical warnings given the high failure percentage of startup businesses. It is one thing to have a great idea, with a potential high commercial value. Turning the idea into a commercial success requires a different kind of skill and business acumen.</p>
<p>For those interested, the website Crunchbase offers a very comprehensive view into activities in the startup arena. The following image shows the average figures on investments that have happened on any given 7-day period, which may be in the tens of billions of dollars:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The human factor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The significant advantages of big data and data science notwithstanding, their successes and breakthrough growth, it is still important to bear in mind that the element of human thinking is essential in all endeavors.</p>
<p>Big data technologies will allow us to analyze data more efficiently. But we still need to use proper judgment to decide on our ideal use cases. This is not trivial. Large companies find initiatives just as challenging (although at a higher scale) as seasoned big data professionals.</p>
<p>Similarly, data science and machine learning can empower us to make predictions and gain foresight with the help of sophisticated algorithms and code. However, it is still incumbent upon the user to evaluate the results and make decisions not solely based on the predicted output. Users should apply common sense and experience in making such assessments. If the GPS instructs the driver to go on a certain road on a snowy winter night and the driver knows that the road won't have been cleared by the snowplow, it wouldn’t be prudent to follow the GPS instructions blindly.</p>
<p>A recent example that illustrated this concept is the disconnect between man and machine during the 2016 election. Extensive models that estimated, using very sophisticated algorithms, the high probability of Clinton winning the elections were all proven wrong. Eminent data scientists and leading statistical organizations estimated that there was an 80-90 percent chance of a Clinton presidency. What we all missed was the human element of making decisions. We relied too intently on model sophistication instead of trying to understand how people really felt and whether their assertions on, say, an informal survey would be aligned with their final choice of candidate and true feelings about them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Characteristics of successful projects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Data science projects, by their very nature, take a long time to realize a return on investment. In particular, it is hard to accurately measure the success of projects that involve making long-term predictions. As noted in an earlier chapter, for departments to advance the cause of data science, it is essential for them to show early successes. In general, projects that a) are short term; b) have a measurable outcome; and c) can benefit and will be used a wide range of users are some of the key factors that help to establish credibility and ensure success of data science related projects.</p>
<p>An example of such a project is Arterys, a cloud-based company that developed a deep learning algorithm in late 2016 that could assess the flow of blood to the heart in a fraction of the time compared to conventional scanners. It met all the key criteria of success. The benefits were obvious almost immediately, the algorithm provided a directly measurable outcome since you could compare the results with those from scanners and it was useful to a broad range of users, namely, patients. Further, the topic was very intuitive.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever had a blood test can intuitively relate to measuring bloodflow. The benefits of such a product are also quite obvious. Being able to get results in a fraction of the time could help save lives. In November 2016, the FDA approved the algorithm. It was a monumental achievement.</p>

<p>Overall, while the path to big data and data science success may seem arduous, hopefully the preceding chapters have provided a comprehensive overview of various topics in big data. We discussed data mining and machine learning, learned about the various tools and technologies in the respective disciplines, and developed applications on real-world data and provided parting thoughts on the nuances of organizational big data and data science initiatives.</p>
<p>The next few pages list some links to resources that the reader may find useful for learning more about the respective subject areas.</p>

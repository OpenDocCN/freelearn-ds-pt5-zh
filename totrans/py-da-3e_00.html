<p class="mce-root">Data analysis enables you to generate value from small and big data by discovering new patterns and trends, and Python is one of the most popular tools for analyzing a wide variety of data. With this book, you'll get up and running with using Python for data analysis by exploring the different phases and methodologies used in data analysis, and you'll learn how to use modern libraries from the Python ecosystem to create efficient data pipelines.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Starting with the essential statistical and data analysis fundamentals using Python, you'll perform complex data analysis and modeling, data manipulation, data cleaning, and data visualization using easy-to-follow examples. You'll then learn how to conduct time series analysis and signal processing using ARMA models. As you advance, you'll get to grips with smart processing and data analytics using machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong> (<strong>PCA</strong>), and clustering. In the concluding chapters, you'll work on real-world examples to analyze textual and image data using <strong>natural language processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>) and image analytics techniques, respectively. Finally, the book will demonstrate parallel computing using Dask.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this data analysis book, you'll be equipped with the skills you need to prepare data for analysis and create meaningful data visualizations in order to forecast values from data.</p>

<p>The execution of the code examples provided in this book requires the installation of Python 3.5 or newer on Mac OS X, Linux, or Microsoft Windows. In this book, we will frequently use SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, and seaborn. Chapter 1, Getting Started with Python Libraries, provides instructions for the installation and advanced tips so that you can work smoothly. Also, the process of installing specific and additional libraries is explained in the respective chapters. Installation of Bokeh is explained in Chapter 5, Data Visualization. Similarly, the installation of NLTK and SpaCy is explained in Chapter 12, Analyzing Textual Data. </p>
<p>We can also install any library or package that you want to explore using the <kbd>pip</kbd> command. We need to run the following command with admin privileges:</p>
<pre>$ pip install &lt;library name&gt;</pre>
<p>We can also install it from our Jupyter Notebook with <kbd>!</kbd> (exclamation mark) before the <kbd>pip</kbd> command:</p>
<pre>!pip install &lt;library name&gt;</pre>
<p>To uninstall a Python library or package installed with <kbd>pip</kbd>, use the following command: </p>

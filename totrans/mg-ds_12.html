<p class="p1">In this chapter, we will explore the common pitfalls of data science projects, as well as the mistakes that increase the risks your projects may encounter and that are easy to commit. It's important that you know how to deal with them for the success of your projects. Different types of data science solutions have many tempting ways of executing the project that can lead to undesired difficulties in the later stages of the project. We will pick and mitigate those issues one by one while following the data science project life cycle.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding the common risks of data science projects</li>
<li>Approaching research projects</li>
<li>Dealing with prototypes and <strong>minimum viable product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>) projects</li>
<li>Mitigating risks in production-oriented data science systems</li>
</ul>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Avoiding the common risks of data science projects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p4">The first and most important risk of any data science project is the goal definition. The correct goal definition plays a major part in the success formula. It is often tempting to jump into the implementation stage of the project right after you have the task definition, regardless of whether it is vague or unclear. By doing this, you risk solving the task in an entirely different way from what the business actually needs. It is important that you define a concrete and measurable goal that will give your team a tool that they can use to distinguish between right and wrong solutions.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p4">To make sure that the project goal is defined correctly, you may use the following checklist:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">You have a quantifiable business metric that can be calculated from the input data and the algorithm's output.</li>
<li class="li5">The business understands the most important technical metrics that you use.</li>
<li class="li5">The task is defined in data science terminology. You know if you are solving classification, regression, or another kind of task and have an idea of how to approach it technically.</li>
<li class="li5">You understand the details of the (business) process and domain of the problem.</li>
<li class="li5">All of the data sources that are required for the start of the project exist and can be accessed by the implementation team.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Another important issue is the documentation. In data science projects, experiment results can often change the course of the project. It is important to log all the experiments, along with the decisions and conclusions that you make. Fixing any incoming changes when it comes to data and requirements is also necessary. When you have this information, you will be able to see the whole line of thought that makes your solution work as it does.</p>
<p>Being aware of the common risks of data science projects will help you recover from major mistakes, but the devil is in the detail. In the next section, we will cover the different management approaches to research projects, prototypes, and end-to-end production systems and cover their specifics.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Approaching research projects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p4">A research project is any project that gives you solutions to new, not well-known problems. Research projects aren't always about advancing science. If your team deals with a new kind of business domain, or a new type of machine learning library, these are also considered to be research projects. Discovering ways to apply data science to new business domains is also research. Almost every data science project includes a research subproject that takes care of the modeling process.</p>
<p class="p4">The first pitfall of research projects is the absence of scope. Every research project must have a clear scope, otherwise it won't be possible to finish it. It is also important to fix any external constraints for a research project. Your research budgets will grow as the scope's size increases, so limited budgets may also affect the depth and length of research that you will be able to do.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p4">When you have an idea of your research capacity, you can start filling in the experiment backlog with your team. Each entry in a backlog should contain an idea that may advance your model's quality or help you reach your desired functionality. Each experiment should be defined in accordance with the SMART criteria.</p>
<p class="p4">For example, an initial experiment backlog for a binary classification problem may look like this:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li5">Perform <strong>exploratory data analysis</strong> (<strong>EDA</strong>) and familiarize yourself with the data.</li>
<li class="li5">Create a baseline model using gradient boosting and basic preprocessing.</li>
<li class="li5">Test the encoding for categorical variables: Hash encoding.</li>
<li class="li5">Test the encoding for categorical variables: Target encoding.</li>
<li class="li5">Feature engineering: Measure the effect of date features.</li>
<li class="li5">Feature engineering: Aggregate the features day windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be SMART-compliant, each entry should also contain deadlines, links to datasets, computation resources, and metric recommendations. We have omitted those details for brevity.</p>
<p class="p4">You should always prioritize experiments by expected returns. Some experiments may take a lot of time to complete in full, but less time for initial tests. If you and your team are unsure about priority, it is better to go wide rather than deep. Perform quick initial quality checks for all of the experiments in your current research iteration to determine the approximate time investment for each experiment.</p>
<p class="p4">It is also important to keep track of everything in an experiment, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input data</li>
<li>Date and time of the experiment</li>
<li>Exact code version that produced the experiment's results</li>
<li>Output files</li>
<li>Model parameters and model type</li>
<li>Metrics</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">You can use a simple shared document for this purpose or invest in integrating a specialized experiment tracking framework with a <strong>user interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>) into your project. Experiment tracking frameworks pay for themselves in projects that have lots of experimentation.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p4">Finally, care about making each experiment reproducible and document the conclusions you drew from the results. To check for reproducibility, use the following criteria for each individual experiment:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">Input data is easily accessible and can be discovered by anyone on the team.</li>
<li class="li5">The experiment code can be run on input data without errors.</li>
<li class="li5">You don't need to enter undocumented configuration parameters to run the experiment. All of the configuration variables are fixed in an experiment configuration.</li>
<li class="li5">The experiment code contains documentation and is easily readable.</li>
<li class="li5">The experiment output is consistent.</li>
<li class="li5">The experiment output contains metrics that you can use for comparison with other experiments.</li>
<li class="li5">Conclusions from experiment results are present in the documentation, comments, or output files.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">To avoid pitfalls in research projects, make sure you do the following:</p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li5">Define a clear goal</li>
<li class="li5">Define the success criteria</li>
<li class="li5">Define constraints, including the time and budget limitations</li>
<li class="li5">Fill in the experiment backlog</li>
<li class="li5">Prioritize by expectations</li>
<li class="li5">Track all the experiments and their data</li>
<li class="li5">Make the code reproducible</li>
<li class="li5">Document your findings</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful research projects can help you find an answer to a complex question or push the boundaries of scientific fields and practical disciplines. Research projects are often confused with prototypes, though prototypes pursuit different goals in general. In the next section, we will look at the properties of prototyping projects, along with specific management strategies for these types of projects.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Dealing with prototypes and MVP projects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p4">If you are dealing with data science, I bet you will find yourself doing a lot of prototyping. Prototypes often have very strict time and money limitations. The first lesson of prototyping is to approach every prototype as an MVP. The key idea behind MVP is to have just enough core features to show a working solution. Bells and whistles can be implemented later, as long as you are able to demonstrate the main idea behind your prototype.</p>
<p class="p4">Focusing on core features does not mean that your prototype should not have a pretty UI or stunning data visualizations. If those are the main strengths of your future product, by no means include them. To identify the core features of your product, you should think in terms of markets and processes.</p>
<p class="p4">Ask yourself the following questions to check whether a particular feature should be included in the MVP:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">Who are your users?</li>
<li class="li5">What (business) processes are your solutions targeting?</li>
<li class="li5">What problem do you want to solve?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">Then, look at what features are crucial for reaching the desired goal, what is complementary, and what is unrelated to the goal. After that, look at your competitors and think about what will distinguish your MVP from them. If you have no distinguishing features or you don't solve a different problem, you will have a hard time competing with an already developed and possibly highly adopted competitive product.</p>
<p class="p5">It is beneficial to decompose your competitor's products into feature lists and perform the same analysis on them to see what supplementary features you should implement to be on par with the market. Doing a detailed feature analysis of competitor products is more about product development than creating an MVP, so we won't go any further into this topic.</p>
<p class="p5">With the information you will have acquired from feature analysis, you should be able to rank all the features and select a few core ones for your MVP. Keep in mind that you may change the priority of some features if you know that they are extremely important for success.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p5">Another important aspect of delivering MVPs is to cut corners. If you have a lot of prototypes, having project templates, internal rapid prototyping tools, and document templates will save you a great deal of time and money. If you feel that your team spends more time creating MVPs using particular types of algorithms or technologies, think about creating tools that will automate most of the work. It is crucial to remember that MVP should be only good enough for your customers and users to see the benefits. As Voltaire said, <em>The best is the enemy of the good.</em> </p>

<p>In the next section, we will have a brief overview of how we can manage an MVP in a consulting company environment. </p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Case study – creating an MVP in a consulting company</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p5">Our friend Mark works at a consulting company. His team has created a defect detection system prototype for a large manufacturing company. The system should analyze the video stream of products on a conveyor belt and detect products that are defective. Mark has answered the initial MVP question list:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">Who are your users?<br/>
The manufacturing plant product quality department.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">What (business) processes are your solutions targeting?<br/>
We target the core product quality control process.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">What problem do you want to solve?<br/>
We want to decrease the total amount of defected products that are left undetected by the current quality control process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">Using these answers, Mark has created the core feature list for the MVP:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">Defect detection model</li>
<li class="li5">Integration by monitoring cameras over the conveyor belt</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">Mark knows that the manufacturing plan director, Anthony, who is the key decision-maker, appreciates systems with a slick and intuitive UI. Also, Mark is sure that preparing a model quality report is essential for comparing the efficiency of as-is and to-be quality control processes.</p>
<p class="p5">These two insights added some more deliverables to the MVP:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">A UI for monitoring defects in real time</li>
<li class="li5">A model quality report that provides an efficiency comparison between the old process and the improved process, along with an automated quality control step</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">After the customer approved the scope, Mark decided to use Scrum as a management methodology and focused on delivering the first working version as fast as possible. To get up to speed, Mark's team, who were already experienced in applying computer vision algorithms, used internal software libraries that they can develop for rapid prototyping. The report template meant that they didn't have to spend a lot of time writing documents, which meant they could focus on MVP development.</p>
<p>This example concludes our overview of prototypes. Now, we are ready to dive into the topic of assessing and mitigating risks in data science projects.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Mitigating risks in production-oriented data science systems</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="p5">End-to-end data science projects encompass one or several full iterations of the data science project life cycle. End-to-end data science projects comprise of all the risks of research projects and MVPs, along with a new set of risks related to change management and production deployment.</p>
<p class="p5">The first major risk is the inability to sustain a constant change stream. Data science projects involve scope changes, and you should be able to work with them without making the project fall apart. Scrum gives you the basic tools you need for change management by freezing the development scope over the course of the week. However, for any tool to work, your customer should understand and follow the required processes, along with your team.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="p5">Another issue is that the implementation of a given change may cause a lot of unexpected bugs. Data science projects often lack automated testing procedures. The absence of constantly testing existing functionality may cause ripple effects when one simple change causes several bugs. Without tests, a lot more bugs also go unnoticed and get passed into production. It is also important to implement online testing modules since quality assurance does not end in the development phase. Models can degrade in performance over time, and your system should monitor abrupt changes in business and technical metrics.</p>
<p class="p5">If your team has not planned for production in advance, you will face many complex engineering issues related to nonfunctional requirements such as the availability, scalability, and reliability of your system. To avoid this, care about system design and software architecture from the start of the project.</p>
<p class="p5">Even if everything has gone well technically, the final result may bewilder your customers. If key stakeholders do not see the benefit of your system, you must look for any mistakes that were in your goal definitions. It is often the case that project goals change midterm, along with the customer's views of what's best for their business. To avoid this major risk, you should constantly check that the task you are working on is important and that the solution method is correct.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Let's move on to the next case study that will demonstrate how you can detect and control these common risks.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>
<div><h1 class="header-title">Case study – bringing a sales forecasting system into production</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jane works as a senior manager in a start-up company that provides sales forecasting solutions to various logistic companies all over the world. During a major tech conference, a logistics company representative called Max asked if Jane's company could benefit from using an AI. Jane mentioned that tools alone won't make the company better, and that AI is a tool too, such as their ERP software, only more flexible. She started by creating a more concrete task definition in order to close off risks from the <strong>common </strong>group in the risk table:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Jane: What about forming a more defined goal? I know it can be hard without knowing about the technical details of AI and machine learning, so let me help you. Our company provides sales forecasting solutions for logistics companies like yours. The typical use case is to integrate our system into your ERP so that your personnel won't waste time making forecasts by hand. Does this sound interesting to you?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Max: Sure, can you tell me more?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Jane: OK. Our system makes demand forecasts for each item in your warehouse. We can estimate the expected number of items that you will need to ship by a given date in the future. To do this, we need access to your ERP database. I bet your employees already do this, but the process generally takes a lot of time and the results are not as accurate as they could be, especially if your product catalog contains hundreds or thousands of items.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Max: Yes, the process takes a lot of time indeed. We even struggle to add new items to the catalog since this will require us to hire twice as many people in the future.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Jane: If what I've offered sounds interesting to you, I'd be happy to assist you in making a small MVP project that will show you how beneficial our system will be to your business. However, we'll need a bit of assistance from your side. To show you the positive effect of using the system, we'll need to make sure that the goal is stated in numbers that can be understood by the company's management. Let's set up a meeting so I can show you how we can quantify the project results and what support we'll need from your IT specialists.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Max: Sure, thanks!</p>
<p>After this discussion, Jane had a meeting with Max, where she showed him a common approach to evaluating the project's performance from the business side. She documented all the decisions in a small business requirements document and confirmed that the results of the discussion were correct by showing it to Max. Jane also discussed the success criteria for the MVP. Max agreed that the production deployment is not necessary at this stage of the project and that they can make a decision about production integration by looking at the offline testing results, which Jane's team will present at a meeting. This way, she covered all three major risks in the <strong>common </strong>group.</p>
<p>Since this is an MVP project, she also considered risks in the MVP group. Jane asked Max how they could present the system to end users and company management so that they can understand the benefits of such a system. They settled on integrating the system directly into the company's ERP solution as this was the most cost-efficient way for both sides. Max had lots of ideas regarding what useful features they could include in the MVP, along with visualization dashboards and system administration tools. Jane noticed that those features did not add to the core value of the system and would be better for the implementation stage to implement.</p>
<p>After creating a clear goal definition and shaping the MVP constraints, Jane's team proceeded to the implementation stage. To close the risks in the project development group, Jane coordinated with the customer about project management methodology. Based on her previous experience, Jane decided to use Scrum for this MVP. She explained the importance of fixed scope iterations to the customer and made sure that everyone agreed on how changes will be incorporated into sprints during the planning phase. She also shared the project's backlog with Max using a software project management system so that he could add new tasks and prioritize them with the team, acting as the product owner. Jane made sure that Max will have the time to participate in the spring planning meetings so that the project won't go astray. The general software development practices in Jane's start-up have already closed risks related to code quality, delivery pipeline automation, and automated testing, so she doesn't need to care about them.</p>

<p class="p4">In this chapter, we have explored the common pitfalls of data science projects, as well as how to manage research projects with tools such as experiment backlog and experiment tracking. We have also seen how prototypes differ from research projects and looked at how to manage prototype development from the standpoint of an MVP. Those techniques were then summarized in a case study that concerned MVP development in a consulting company. Finally, we enumerated and systematized the major risks and their solutions for research, prototype, and production systems.</p>
<p class="p4">In the next chapter, we will look at how to grow data science products and improve internal team performance by using reusable technology.</p>

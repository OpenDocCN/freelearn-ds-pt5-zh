    journey of reading through these long chapters and perhaps trying some or all
    of the sample code provided. I tried to provide a good mix between diving into
    the fundamentals of a particular topic, such as deep learning or time series analysis,
    and giving comprehensive example code for the practitioner. I especially hope
    that you found the idea of tightly integrating the data science analytics with
    the PixieApp application programming model in a single Jupyter Notebook interesting
    and novel. But, most importantly, I hope that you found it useful and something
    you can reuse in your own projects and with your own teams.

    the Drew''s Conway Venn Diagram (which is one of my favorites) as a representation
    of what is data science and why data scientists are widely considered unicorns.
    With all respect to Drew Conway, I''d like to extend this diagram to denote the
    important and growing role of developers in the field of data science, as shown

    – A New Toolset"), *Programming and Data Science – A New Toolset*, I believe that
    AI and data science are here to stay, and they will continue to cause disruption
    to existing industries for the foreseeable future, most likely at an accelerating
    rate. This will certainly have an effect on the overall number of jobs and, similar
    to other technological revolutions we've seen in the past (agricultural, industrial,
    information, and many more), some will disappear, while new ones will be created.

    Trump ([https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect)),
    talks about the need to better prepare for the AI revolution by creating new types
    of jobs that she calls "new collar," as shown in the following excerpt:'

- en: '"Getting a job at today''s IBM does not always require a college degree; at
    some of our centers in the United States, as many as one third of employees have
    less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes
    obtained through vocational training. In addition, we are creating and hiring
    to fill "new collar" jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity,
    data science, artificial intelligence and cognitive business."'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These "new collar" jobs can only be created in sufficient numbers if we are
    successful in our quest to democratize data science, because data science is the
    lifeblood of AI and everyone needs to be involved in some capacity; developers,
    line of business users, data engineers, and so on. It is easy to imagine that
    the demand for these new types of jobs will be so high that traditional academic
    tracks will not be able to fill the needs. Rather, it will be incumbent upon the
    industry to fill the void by creating new programs designed to retrain all existing
    workers whose jobs may be at risk of becoming redundant. New programs similar
    to the *Everyone Can Code* program from Apple ([https://www.apple.com/everyone-can-code](https://www.apple.com/everyone-can-code))
    will emerge; perhaps something like *Anyone can do Data Science*. I also think
    that **MOOCs** (short for, **Massive Open Online Courses**) will play an even
    greater role that we already see today with the many partnerships being formed
    between key MOOC players such as Coursera and edX, and companies like IBM (see
    [https://www.coursera.org/ibm](https://www.coursera.org/ibm)).

    I talk about three pillars for a data science strategy that can help us with this
    ambitious goal: data, services, and tools.'

    to the overall increase in high-quality services in multiple fields: data persistence,
    cognitive, streaming, and so on. Providers such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM,
    and Microsoft are taking a leading role in building innovative capabilities with
    a service-first approach backed by a strong platform that provides a consistent
    experience for developers. This trend will continue to accelerate, with more and
    more powerful services being released at an increasingly rapid rate.'

    which taught itself chess in 4 hours and went on to beat a champion chess program.
    Another great example comes from IBM's recently announced project debater ([https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/project-debater](https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/project-debater)),
    which is the first AI system that can debate a human on complex topics. These
    types of advances will continue to fuel the availability of more and more powerful
    services that can be accessed by everyone, including developers. Chatbots are
    another example of services that have been successfully democratized as it has
    never been easier for developers to create applications that contain conversational
    capabilities. I believe that consuming these services will become easier and easier
    over time, enabling developers to build amazing new applications that we can't
    even begin to imagine today.

- en: On the data side, we need to make accessing high-quality data much easier than
    it is today. One model I have in mind is coming from a television show called
    *24*. Full disclosure; I love watching, and binging on, TV series and I think
    that some of them provide a good indicator of where technology is headed. In *24*, Jack
    Bauer, a counter-terrorism agent, has 24 hours to stop bad guys from causing catastrophic
    events. Watching that show, I'm always amazed at how easy the data circulates
    from the analyst back at the command center to the mobile phone of Jack Bauer,
    or how, given a data problem with only minutes to solve, the analyst is able to
    summon the data from different systems (satellite images, system of records, and
    so on) to zero-in on the bad guys; for example, we're looking for someone who
    bought this type of chemicals in the last 2 months and within a given radius.
    Wow! from my perspective, this is how easy and frictionless it should be for data
    scientists to access and process data. I believe we are making great progress
    toward this goal with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks that act as a control plane
    for connecting data sources with services and analytics that process them. Jupyter
    Notebooks bring tools to the data instead of the opposite, thus lowering greatly
    the cost of entry for anyone who wants to get involved in data science.
